<P>For the past several years, we have been studying the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region of the mouse, located on chromosome 17 
immediately to the right of (distal to) the major histocompatibility complex. We first became interested in this region 
after our initial discovery that it may code for several cell surface antigens in addition to TL (
<A HREF="#ref26-1">1</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref26-2">2</A>). Since then we have made a determined effort to define and more precisely locate these newly discovered 
cell surface loci and determine their characteristics. So far, six cell surface loci have been mapped to this region; two 
which determine skin and tumor graft rejection -- 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95979" target="_blank"><I>H-31</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95980" target="_blank"><I>H-32</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-2">2</A>) -- and four which determine differentiation antigens on lymphoid cells -- 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-3">3</A>), 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-4">4</A>), 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-5">5</A>), and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>). In addition, two genes which determine isozyme variations -- 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97563" target="_blank"><I>Pgk-2</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-7">7</A>) and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88364" target="_blank"><I>Ce-2</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-8">8</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref26-9">9</A>) -- have also been located here.

<P>In this report, I will present the general characteristics of the serologically defined cell surface loci with particular 
emphasis on the newly discovered Qa series of antigens, pointing out the similarities and differences between them. I will 
also present data on the strain and substrain distributions of some of these antigens.

<P><CENTER>Characteristics of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> Region Cell Surface Loci</CENTER>

<P>
<a href="javascript:windowt261 = window.open('../tables/table26-1.shtml', 'windowt261', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt261.focus()">Table 1</A> and

give a general description and mapping of these loci. Fuller descriptions are given below.

<P>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A>. The 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> locus was first discovered in 1963 by Old and co-workers (
<A HREF="#ref26-3">3</A>). It determines a series of thymus-leukemia specific antigens called TL. They found that there were three alleles determining 
four TL antigens (
<A HREF="#ref26-4">4</A>). The fourth allele and fifth antigenic specificity were found by Flaherty <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref26-12">12</A>) in an analysis of the antibodies contained within an anti-H-2 serum.

<P>These TL antigens have several unusual properties (for review see reference 
<A HREF="#ref26-11">11</A>). First, they undergo a process known as antigenic modulation in which the presence of TL antibody or its Fab fragment induces 
the phenotypic loss of TL from the cell surface. Second, they appear on leukemias of mice which do not ordinarily express these antigens on their 
thymuses. Moreover, this leukemic TL expression is genetically determined since only certain TL phenotypes can appear on a leukemia from a given 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> genotype. And third, TL antigens have a reciprocal quantitative relationship with the antigens determined by a closely linked locus, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95896" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>, such that a TL<SUP>+</SUP> cell expresses less H-2D antigen than a TL<SUP>-</SUP> cell.

<P>Because of these characteristics and others, Boyse and Old (
<A HREF="#ref26-13">13</A>) have suggested that there are actually two components to the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> locus, one "structural" and one "expressional." The 
structural component directly specifies the TL protein while the expressional component determines the presence or absence of it. No crossing-over 
has ever been observed within the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> locus separating these components. (For a further discussion of these two components and the mapping of them to the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> locus, see reference 
<A HREF="#ref26-13">13</A>).

<P>Biochemically, the molecules expressing the TL antigens have a molecular weight of 45,000 with a &beta;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin subcomponent 
making them similar to the H-2D and H-2K molecules (
<A HREF="#ref26-14">14</A>).

<A NAME="Qa-1"></A>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A>. The 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> locus determines the presence or absence of the Qa-1 antigen (
<A HREF="#ref26-4">4</A>). It appears on thymocytes as well as on a precise subpopulation of peripheral T lymphocytes. This tissue distribution distinguishes 
it from the known set of TL antigens which are found exclusively in the thymus.

<P>The 
<I>Qa-1</I></A> locus (or loci) may be complex. Stanton and Boyse (
<A HREF="#ref26-4">4</A>) originally observed that different anti-Qa-1 sera gave slightly different strain distributions, consequently they have suggested 
that at least one of their anti-Qa-1 sera may have more than one antibody against peripheral lymph node cells.

<P>Using the B6.K1 and B6.K2 recombinant strains, they have preliminarily mapped the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> locus to the chromosome stretch between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95896" target="_blank"><I>H2-D</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A>. (B6.K1, B6.K2, and B6-<I>Tla<SUP>a</SUP></I> are all Qa-1<SUP>+</SUP> while B6 and B6-
<I>H-2<SUP>k</SUP></I> are Qa-1<SUP>-</SUP>; see 
<a href="javascript:windowf262 = window.open('../figures/figure26-2.shtml', 'windowf262', 'width=800,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf262.focus()">Figure 2</A>.) 
However, in a further serological analysis of the Qa-1 antigen and its strain distribution, Stanton has found that a 
change in the source of rabbit complement or antiserum batch alters the activity of the anti-Qa-1 serum against B6.K1 and B6.K2 (
<A HREF="#ref26-15">15</A>).
<SUP><A HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP> These results suggest that there is more than one activity in anti-Qa-1 sera and thus makes the mapping of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> locus difficult. We have therefore placed a question mark after 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> in our chromosomal map of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region and feel that the main Qa-1 activity may be due to a locus more closely linked to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A>.

<P>The Qa-1 antigen has not been biochemically analyzed.

<A NAME="Qa-2"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A>. The 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> locus located between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95896" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> determines the presence or absence of the differentiation antigen 
Qa-2. We originally described this locus as a complex determining at least two antigenic specificities (
<A HREF="#ref26-5">5</A>). By further serological analysis, we have now subdivided this locus into two loci, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A> (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>). 
<I>Qa-3</I></A> will be described in the next section.

<P>As with the Qa-1 antigen, Qa-2 is on a restricted population of lymphocytes as seen by its low expression on thymocytes (&#126;20% are Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP>) and 
its high expression on lymph node cells (&#062;65% are Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP>). It is also present in the spleen and bone marrow. By cytotoxicity testing, 
it is predominantly expressed on Thy-1<SUP>+</SUP> lymphocytes although at least some Thy-1<SUP>-</SUP> cells are Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>). In addition, it is present on some T cell leukemias; both TL<SUP>+</SUP> and TL<SUP>-</SUP> leukemias can be Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP>.

<P>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> is also associated with a CML (cell-mediated lympholysis) locus. Forman and Flaherty (
<A HREF="#ref26-16">16</A>) have found that <I>Qa-2<SUP>b</SUP></I> lymphocytes will kill Con A blasts from a <I>Qa-2<SUP>a</SUP></I> mouse in a secondary <I>in vitro</I> 
CML test. This killing correlates completely with our strain distribution for the serologically detectable Qa-2 antigen.

<A NAME="Qa-3"></A>
<P>
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A>. The 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A> locus was separated from 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> on the basis of both the strain and tissue distributions of the Qa-2 and Qa-3 antigens 
which they determine. Qa-3 is more limited in its tissue distribution than Qa-2 and is only present on lymph node and spleen cells. It is absent from at least 
two inbred strains of mice which type Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> (<I>Qa-2<SUP>a</SUP></I>) (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>). These results indicate that Qa-3 is different from Qa-2 and is determined by a different locus, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A>. So far we have not 
detected any recombinants between Qa-2 and Qa-3, and therefore the precise position of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A> is not known (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf261 = window.open('../figures/figure26-1.shtml', 'windowf261', 'width=900,height=300,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf261.focus()">Figure 1</A>).

<P>Using immunoprecipitation techniques, Michaelson <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref26-17">17</A>) have shown that an antiserum which contains both Qa-2 and Qa-3 activity precipitates a molecule of approximately 45,000 daltons with a 
&beta;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin subcomponent. Subsequent studies have preliminarily shown that the main molecule precipitated by this serum is the Qa-3 
molecule (Michaelson <I>et al.</I>, personal communication). The molecular weight of the Qa-2 molecule is still not known.

<P><CENTER>BALB/c Sublines and Their Qa Phenotypes</CENTER>

<P>In the course of testing different strains of mice for their Qa phenotype, we have found that certain BALB/c sublines differ at both the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A> loci (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>).

<P>The BALB/c strain was derived from a colony of albino mice maintained by Bagg. In the early 1920s, MacDowell obtained this colony from Little and proceeded 
to inbreed it. In 1932, it was given to Snell in the F<SUB>26</SUB> generation, who subsequently gave it to Andervont, Green, and Scott. It was then widely 
distributed to many laboratories. 
<a href="javascript:windowf263 = window.open('../figures/figure26-3.shtml', 'windowf263', 'width=650,height=800,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf263.focus()">Figure 3</A> 
gives a partial pedigree of the BALB/c strain with our current knowledge of its distribution (
<A HREF="#ref26-18">18</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref26-19">19</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref26-20">20</A>).

In our Qa-2 and Qa-3 typings, we have found that the BALB/c sublines have two Qa phenotypes -- all lines derived from Green or Scott are Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>+</SUP>, 
while most of the lines derived from Andervont are Qa-2<SUP>-</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>-</SUP>. One BALB/cAn-derived line, BALB/cBoy (and therefore also all strains 
derived from it such as BALB/cFla), is Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>+</SUP>.

The simplest explanation for this genetic divergence is that either a mutation or deletion occurred in the BALB/cAn line. It is unlikely that it is due to foreign genes 
still segregating from the original Bagg albino stock since the BALB/c strain was at least in its F<SUB>29</SUB> generation when given to Andervont. We have also typed 
these sublines for the neighboring loci, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95896" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>, <I>D'</I> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A>, and found them to be identical (
<a href="javascript:windowt262 = window.open('../tables/table26-2.shtml', 'windowt262', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt262.focus()">Table 2</A>). 
If the Qa-2 and Qa-3 phenotypes were maintained from the original heterogeneity in the Bagg albino stock, it would be very unlikely that 
neighboring genes would not also be affected. Therefore, our hypothesis of a mutation or a deletion seems to be the most tenable one at the present time. The skin 
grafting results presented in Table 2 between BALB/cBy and BALB/cFla also indicate that there are other genetic differences between these two lines. This is not 
surprising since these strains are at least 60 generations apart.

<P>If our hypothesis that a mutation or deletion occurred in the BALB/cAn subline is correct, it would indicated that this genetic event (or two consecutive events) modified both 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A>.

<P><CENTER>Relationships Between the <I>Tla</I> Region Loci</CENTER>

<P>In our typings of a number of inbred and recombinant strains of mice, we have noticed several correlations between the alleles within the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region and between the alleles of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region and the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> region (
<a href="javascript:windowt263 = window.open('../tables/table26-3.shtml', 'windowt263', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt263.focus()">Table 3</A>).

<P>First, there is a strong correlation between the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> genotype and the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> genotype. Most, if not all, tested strains which are 
<I>Qa-1<SUP>a</SUP></I> are either <I>Tla<SUP>a</SUP></I> or <I>Tla<SUP>d</SUP></I>, while all tested strains which are 
<I>Qa-1<SUP>b</SUP></I> are either 
<I>Tla<SUP>b</SUP></I> or 
<I>Tla<SUP>c</SUP></I>. This may simply be because 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> are tightly linked. Since many of the inbred strains have a common ancestry (
<A HREF="#ref26-21">21</A>) it would be likely that the alleles of these two loci would then be preserved together. At present the position of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A> in relationship to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> is somewhat in doubt, and therefore this hypothesis must be considered a viable one. Alternatively, of course, there may be some functional relationship 
between these two genes. Currently, there are not enough data to suggest which of these hypotheses is correct.

<P>With few exceptions, there is a strong correlation between the strain distribution of the H-2D.28 specificity and the Qa-2 antigen. All tested inbred strains which 
have been described as H-2D.28<SUP>-</SUP> are also Qa-2<SUP>-</SUP> (<I>H-2<SUP>f,k,p,r</SUP></I>). We have investigated this correlation and found that one reason 
for it is probably due to the contamination of at least one anti-H-2.28 typing serum with anti-Qa-2 activity (
<A HREF="#ref26-6">6</A>). By absorption and direct cytotoxicity testing, we have found that the anti-H-2.28 serum (B10.BR x A.CA) anti-A.SW contains a substantial amount 
of anti-Qa-2 (and/or Qa-3) activity. Thus a strain would only appear negative with this typing antiserum if it were also negative for Qa-2 and appear positive if 
it were positive for either H-2.28 or Qa-2.

<A NAME="tandem_duplication"></A>
<P>Structurally the Qa-3 and TL molecules are very similar to the H-2K, H-2D, and D' molecules; they are all approximately 45,000 daltons in size and associated with 
&beta;<SUB>2</SUB>-microglobulin. Immunoprecipitation techniques have so far been unsuccessful in determining the molecular weights of the Qa-1 and Qa-2 molecules. These 
similar molecular weights might indicate that these genes have a common evolutionary ancestry.

<P>The most interesting relationship to us is that between the expression of Qa-2 and Qa-3. In typing a large number of inbred and recombinant strains plus a few wild 
haplotypes, we have only observed three Qa phenotypes -- Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>+</SUP>, Qa-2<SUP>-</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>-</SUP> and Qa-2<SUP>+</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>-</SUP> 
(and not Qa-2<SUP>-</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>+</SUP>). This is also true for the tissue and tumor distributions of these antigens. There seems to be an obligatory requirement for 
Qa-2 in order for Qa-3 to be expressed. This is similar to the relationship between two of the TL antigens, Tl.2 and Tl.3 (
<A HREF="#ref26-22">22</A>). In all known cases, there is no strain or leukemia which expresses TL.3 without expressing TL.2.

<A NAME="Qanull"></A>
<P>I would like to comment on one last point. Even though our information is still limited on the <I>Qa</I> loci, we have observed that in contrast to the neighboring 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> complex, the genes of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95928" target="_blank"><I>Qa-1</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A>, do not appear to be highly polymorphic and each appears 
to have an allele which is serologically undetectable. In the cases of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95932" target="_blank"><I>Qa-3</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> we have made several efforts to induce antibodies 
against these alternative gene products especially those potentially governed by null alleles but have been unsuccessful. This is also true of the CML locus associated with 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97833" target="_blank"><I>Qa-2</I></A>. Forman and Flaherty (
<A HREF="#ref26-16">16</A>) have found that this reaction is unidirectional; <I>Qa-2<SUP>b</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>b</SUP></I> lymphocytes will kill <I>Qa-2<SUP>a</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>a</SUP></I> 
cells but the reciprocal is not true. The level of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against <I>Qa-2<SUP>a</SUP> Qa-3<SUP>a</SUP></I> cells also does not vary significantly 
from strain to strain, indicating that, if polymorphism exists, all the differing gene products behave similarly. We realize that congenic immunizations are sometimes 
difficult (
<A HREF="#ref26-23">23</A>) and that <I>Ir</I> genes are sometimes important in detecting mouse alloantigens (
<A HREF="#ref26-24">24</A>); however, it is still interesting to speculate that the <I>Tla</I> region might have several true null alleles which do not code for allogenic cell 
surface antigens.

<P>Research on the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> region and the differentiation antigens which it determines is relatively new. Three of these antigens were only discovered within the 
last two years and have not been fully characterized. Even with our limited knowledge of this genetic region, it is becoming apparent that this region is complex and 
might have some unique properties. We hope that it will provide us with information not only on the genetic control of the lymphoid cell surface but also on its 
differentiation.

later appeared to be either weakly positive or negative. In our laboratory we have also confirmed these findings. Using a different anti-Qa-1 serum, 
(A.SW x A.TL) anti-A.TH, we have found that certain sources of rabbit complement will show B6.K1 and B6.K2 as weakly positive where others will show 
these strains to be negative (
