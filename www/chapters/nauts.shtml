<H2>Introductory Remarks</H2>

<H3>Helen C. Nauts<BR><BR>

Cancer Research Institute<BR>
New York, New York</H3>

<P>It is a privilege for the Cancer Research Institute to co-sponsor this workshop as a way to honor the scientists 
whose pioneering efforts gave us the inbred mouse. This experimental animal continues to be one of the most powerful 
resources available to science in the investigation of the diseases that plague mankind.

<P>Not only have studies in inbred mice illuminated our understanding of a range of pathological processes, such as 
infectious diseases and metabolic and neurological disorders, they have given us penetrating insights into normal 
biological mechanisms. Nowhere is this more beautifully illustrated than in our growing comprehension of the intricacies 
of the immunological system.

<P>But it is in the area of cancer that the inbred mouse has made its most enduring contribution to our growing understanding 
of this major disease of mankind. The role of viruses in the development of cancer, the influence of genetics on cancer 
susceptibility, insights into chemical carcinogenesis and the involvement of endocrine and nutritional factors are some 
of the landmarks of scientific inquiry into cancer made possible through the development of the inbred mouse.

<P>The Cancer Research Institute, in the 25 years since it was founded in New York City, has helped to initiate, support, 
and coordinate research into immunological approaches to the control, and hopefully the eventual prevention of cancer. 
Much of the work that has been supported by the Institute, particularly in our International Fellowship Training Program, 
focuses on studies in inbred mice.

<P>The Trustees and Scientific Advisory Council of our Institute join me in congratulating those who are honored today for 
their outstanding achievements. No award, however, can be sufficient to express the appreciation of the scientific community 
for the precious gifts each one of you has given us.
