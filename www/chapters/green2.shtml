The Jackson Laboratory<BR>
Bar Harbor, Maine</H3>

<P>I was walking across the campus of Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, one day early in June of 1932. 
Examinations were over. I was almost 19 years old and I had just completed my freshman year of college. Approaching me 
from the opposite direction was the professor, Dr. Darling, under whom I had taken my first year-long course in biology. 
Dr. Chester Arthur Darling was a large man with gruff but kindly ways of dealing with students. He had been a professor 
at Allegheny for nearly 15 years after having completed his study for the Ph.D. degree at Columbia University.

<P>He said to me, "Say, Green, you live in town, don't you? How would you like to take care of the mouse colony this 
summer? The chap who has been doing the job is going to be away."

<P>I must have said, "Yes," because soon I was engaged in the daily ritual of feeding and watering about 50 pens of 
mice and the weekly tasks of trying to clean and repair the wooden pens. I got bored with pouring water into clean dishes, 
placing them in the mouse pens, and observing soon thereafter that the mice had pushed the bedding into the dishes and, 
a little later, that they had defecated and urinated into the dishes as well. I'm not sure I knew those four-syllable 
words at that time. I devised an automatic watering system, based on the hanging-drop principle now in universal use. 
My system was, however, crude and inefficient compared with later devices. I had trouble getting the aperture, through 
which the droplets of water were to pass, small enough to suspend the drops and not allow water to run continuously. I 
was grateful for the advances, made by others, of devising glass "goosenecks" and stainless steel sipper tubes. I 
continued the husbandry of mice through the rest of my years at Allegheny.

<A NAME="strong"></A>
<P>Shortly after I started tending the mice, Dr. Darling referred to one of the stocks as "the strong strain." This made 
me a bit timid about dealing with them. Even though they looked tame enough, I didn't want to test their strength just yet. 
The next summer, Dr. Darling introduced me to a visitor, Dr. Leonell C. Strong of The Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory 
in Bar Harbor, Maine. It dawned on me eventually that I had been husbanding "the Strong strain," for Dr. Strong had given 
some breeding pairs of his Strain A mice to Dr. Darling some years earlier. This was my first contact with an inbred strain of mice.

<P>During my second year at Allegheny, I took a course in heredity. One day, in the mouse room, Dr. Darling asked me if I had 
thought of any project I might undertake with mice. I said I wanted to cross a black mouse with a brown mouse and to mate the 
offspring together to see if I got a litter with three black mice and one brown mouse in it.

<P>Dr. Darling said, "What are you going to do if the litter has five mice in it?"

<P>The look of perplexity, commingled with chagrin, that swept over my face must have amused Dr. Darling. The next thing I 
heard was, "Heh, heh, heh."

<P>It wouldn't have been so bad if he had not laughed. I was playing the role of a carefree trout that had taken a beautiful fly; 
that laugh sunk the hook in. Damn it, why hadn't I thought of that? I know very well that mice had litters ranging from one or 
two up to 12 or 13. Clearly there was only one thing to do: charge ahead and hope for revelation later.

<P>I made up the matings between black and brown mice and between members of the F<SUB>1</SUB> generation to produce the 
F<SUB>2</SUB> generation. I devised a system of record-keeping that with successive modifications, served me through four 
decades. With the data in hand, I went to the library -- "Heh, heh, heh," still sounding in my ears -- to see if I could 
get help in understanding what I had found. Remember the time is 1933, and the statistical resources available to students 
in a small general college library were primitive compared with those of the present. Actually, I was not able to resolve 
the question until 1937 when I was in graduate school. That is when Snedecor's first edition of <I>Statistical Methods</I> 
appeared. Then I learned about attributes (now called discrete variables), probability, the binomial distribution, the 
computation of expected frequencies, and the testing of deviations of observed from expected numbers by the use of the chi-square distribution.

<A NAME="snell"></A>
<P>Having gone to the library for one purpose, I developed the habit of returning for another. The college had just completed 
a new wing on its library building. In it were individual study carrels near the stacks. The librarian assigned me one of the 
carrels, and I started to search books and journals for information about mouse genetics. I became familiar with <I>Genetics</I>, 
<I>The American Naturalist</I>, <I>Journal of Heredity</I>, <I>Science</I>, and many other journals. I also met the names and 
the works of Morgan, Castle, Little, Wright, Haldane, Darbyshire, Detlefsen, Gates, Snell, Dunn, Keeler, and many others. One day 
the librarian gave me a copy of a publication she was about to discard. It was a paper-bound monograph of the Carnegie Institution of 
Washington dated 1914. It contained C.C. Little's doctoral dissertation on mouse breeding experiments, submitted to the Harvard 
faculty in fulfillment of the requirements for the doctoral degree. It contained several plates, in color, of mice of various 
coat colors. It would be another 50 years before colored photographs of mice appeared in print for the aid of the novice.

<P>My project as a college student laid the foundation for my lifelong interest in genetics and statistics. What had been an accidental 
meeting on a college campus led to my decision to major in biology as an undergraduate. That, in turn, led to the decision to pursue 
graduate work in genetics.

<A NAME="sawin"></A>
<P>In the fall of 1936, I entered the Graduate School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, as a teaching assistant in 
comparative anatomy of the vertebrates and as an advisee of Dr. Herbert Eugene Walter and Dr. Paul Baldwin Sawin. The other teaching 
assistant was a red-haired girl named Margaret Creighton, from New London, Connecticut.

<P>Dr. Sawin advised me to take a course in statistics offered by Professor A.A. Bennett in the Mathematics Department. The course 
was a valuable introduction to the concepts and methods of statistics. More valuable was a friendship with Professor Bennett that 
continued throughout my five years at Brown. He helped a small self-organized group of graduate students to conduct a study of Snedecor's 
first edition of <I>Statistical Methods</I>.

<P>Dr. Sawin had recently discovered a skeletal variation in his stocks of rabbits. I became interested in seeing if similar variations 
occurred in existing inbred strains of mice. We procured samples of various strains of mice from The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor 
and from Dr. Strong who was then at Yale University. It turned out that there were four primary types of axial skeletons with respect to 
the ratio of thoracic-to-lumbar vertebrae. Some strains had 13/6 as the typical numbers. This was regarded as "normal" or "standard." Some 
strains, however, had 13/5, some had 13/7, and some had 12/7 as typical numbers. The mice within strains were similar, but not identical. 
Each strain produced a small percentage of mice that were not typical of the strain. This was my own first-hand encounter with the idea of 
variation within an inbred strain. Many years earlier, in 1905, Johannsen had established that pure lines of beans exhibit variation and do 
not respond to selection. The idea of nongenetic variation within inbred strains of mice is still, today, a difficult idea for some people to grasp.

<P>I decided to carry out an intensive analysis of the visibly most variable of the strains, the Bagg albino strain (denoted as BALB/cJ in 
now-conventional symbols), modeled upon the classical analysis that Sewall Wright had then recently published on the inheritance of three 
and four toes in guinea pigs. I found that, in the Bagg albino strain, the parent-offspring and the sib-sib correlations were essentially 
zero, showing that variation within the strain had primarily nongenetic causes (
<A HREF="#ref13-1">1</A>).

<A NAME="little"></A><A NAME="heston"></A>
<P>While I was a graduate student at Brown, I arranged to spend part of two summers, 1938 and 1939, at The Jackson Laboratory, primarily to 
sample more strains of mice for skeletal variations. Dr. C.C. Little, to whom I first wrote, responded with characteristic enthusiasm inviting 
me to be under the tutelage of Dr. W.L. Russell, then on the staff. It was then that I also met, for the first time, Dr. Elizabeth Russell, 
Dr. George D. Snell, and Dr. Walter E. Heston. Aside from the scientific value of those two summers, they were enlightening in another 
important way. I discovered that to be interested in the genetics of the mouse need not be a solitary endeavor. There were others who were 
seriously and professionally occupied in advancing knowledge in this domain. At the time I was there, the staff of The Jackson Laboratory was 
deeply occupied in preparing manuscripts for the <I>Biology of the Laboratory Mouse</I>, published in 1941, under the editorship of George Snell.

<P>While I was at Brown, I became interested in the problem of trying to discover the intimate multiple effects of single named mutations in 
the mouse. A candidate gene for such studies seemed to be the short-ear (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1856150" target="_blank"><I>se</I></A>) mutation, discovered in 1921 
by Dr. Clara Lynch. I decided to make this the major effort of a year of postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago under the sponsorship 
of Professor Sewall Wright. Brown University awarded me a Corinna Borden Keen Fellowship to make such a year possible (
<A HREF="#ref13-2">2</A>).

<P>But first things first. A few days after I arrived in Chicago, Margaret Creighton also, by prearrangement, arrived. Less than a week later, 
we were married. Margaret had stayed at Brown as a graduate student for two years and then had gone to the State University of Iowa at Iowa 
City to complete her work for the Ph.D. degree in cytogenetics under the supervision of Dr. William Rees Brebner Robinson. Together, Margaret 
and I undertook the analysis of the effects of the short-ear gene. Our study was designed as a comparison of mice of two short-eared strains, 
P and NB, with mice of a normal-eared strain, Bagg albino. It took very little imagination to realize that any difference we might find between 
the strains could be due to any number of causes other than the alleles of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88181" target="_blank"><I>se</I></A> locus (
<A HREF="#ref13-3">3</A>).

<P>I spent much of that year trying to comprehend the details of a paper by Bartlett and Haldane, published in 1935, on the theory of inbreeding 
with forced heterozygosis. The idea of mating brother and sister mice, deliberately selected to preserve heterozygosity at a specified locus, 
was easy enough to comprehend. But the method of analysis -- the generation matrix method introduced by Bartlett and Haldane -- required a bit 
more study. In any case, we decided to create some new inbred strains, each segregating for the two alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88181" target="_blank"><I>se</I></A> locus. Of the five 
strains we started at the time, two have survived to the present: SEA/GnJ and SEC/1Gn. To the best of our knowledge, these were the first strains 
of mice deliberately bred as segregating inbred strains. Now there are dozens of such strains. They are among the strains of choice when one 
wishes to discover the effects of a named mutation on any aspect of the biology of the mouse.

<P>We moved to Columbus, Ohio, -- mice and all -- in 1941 upon my appointment to the faculty of the Ohio State University. The pursuit of the 
multiple effects of the alleles of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88181" target="_blank"><I>se</I></A> locus was carried 
forth after that time largely by Margaret Creighton Green (
<A HREF="#ref13-4">4</A>). In the time available, which was not much because of military service and, after the war, because of heavy teaching loads, 
I continued the analysis of skeletal variations by carrying out classical crosses between several pairs of strains differing in skeletal types (
<A HREF="#ref13-5">5</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-6">6</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-7">7</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-8">8</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-9">9</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-10">10</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-11">11</A>).

<A NAME="furless"></A>
<P>During our period in Ohio State University, I discovered a marked difference in skeletal types between sublines of the C3H strain. I had 
procured samples of C3H mice from eight sources and found that they fell into to groups: one group with five lumbar vertebrae, the other 
with six. I recommended that C3H mice be carefully denoted as C3H/St or C3H/He (
<A HREF="#ref13-12">12</A>). During this same period, I also carried out the genetic analysis of a new condition, called furless (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88564" target="_blank">fs</A>) (
<A HREF="#ref13-13">13</A>).

<P>In 1956, Margaret and I moved our household goods to Bar Harbor and our mouse colony to The Jackson Laboratory. I had just been appointed 
to succeed D. C.C. Little as director of the Laboratory, and we had both been appointed to the research staff.

<P>My major research effort, starting at this time and continuing for about 18 years, was an attempt to detect the effects of various levels 
of ionizing radiation on the genetic makeup of small populations of mice. I started the experiments with two kinds of mice: 1) a founding 
population, called "inbred," that traced ancestry to a single pair in the C57BL/10Gn strain, and 2) a founding population, called "hybrid," 
that traced ancestry to four inbred strains, C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, C3HeB/FeJ, and BALB/cJ. I deliberately varied the sizes of the experimental 
populations to provide four levels of inbreeding in the populations in each experiment. The idea was that lower levels of inbreeding favor 
the accumulation of recessive mutations, both viable and lethal, and that the "hybrid" populations would be able to withstand the effects of 
accumulated mutations more easily than the "inbred." The surprising outcome of these experiments was that essentially nothing affecting 
fitness traits seemed to happen in the populations. They continued for 20 generations with essentially no change (
<A HREF="#ref13-14">14</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-15">15</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-16">16</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-17">17</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-18">18</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-19">19</A>). 

<P>Several other investigators had designed somewhat comparable experiments about the same time. At a symposium held at The Jackson Laboratory 
in 1964 and in subsequent publications, they reported essentially negative results as well (
<A HREF="#ref13-20">20</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-21">21</A>). 

<A NAME="dickie"></A>
<P>Another project required less of my time. In the early 1960s, The Jackson Laboratory was producing about a million mice per year in 18 different 
inbred strains and six F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid generations. I organized a large-scale study to estimate the natural mutation rates of the mouse. The 
project extended over seven years and entailed examining seven million mice; it became a major endeavor of Dr. Margaret M. Dickie and Dr. Gunther Schlager (
<A HREF="#ref13-22">22</A>).

<P>Throughout my period at The Jackson Laboratory, I tried to make various aspects of the mouse-breeders art comprehensible to research workers in 
other fields, so they could make better choices of the kinds of mice to use in their research. For instance, when should one use inbred vs. random-bred 
mice? How much genetic uniformity can one expect after a given number of generations of brother-sister inbreeding? How efficient are the methods of 
producing segregating inbred strains and congenic inbred strains? What is the special value of coisogenic inbred strains? I had two opportunities to 
write expository papers on these questions for publication in the scientific literature (
<A HREF="#ref13-23">23</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-24">24</A>).

<P>Another major endeavor was the organizing and editing of a second edition of the <I>Biology of the Laboratory Mouse</I>, which came put in 1966 and was 
republished in 1975 (
<A HREF="#ref13-25">25</A>).

<A NAME="opossum"></A><A NAME="pale_ear"></A><A NAME="shambling"></A>
<P>I had the good fortune to discover four useful mutations in the mice in my research stocks: opossum (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1856136" target="_blank"><I>Ra<SUP>op</SUP></I></A>), pale ears (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1856712" target="_blank"><I>ep</I></A>), shambling (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98298" target="_blank"><I>shm</I></A>), and a remutation to albinism (
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1855985" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>2J</SUP></I></A>) (
<A HREF="#ref13-26">26</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-27">27</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-28">28</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref13-29">29</A>).

<P>Between the summer of 1932, when I started working with mice, and the summer of 1975, when I retired, I think I have learned a fair amount about the 
genetics and biology of the mouse. I might even be able to handle a questions such as, "What will you do if there are five mice in the litter?"
