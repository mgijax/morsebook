<P>For someone who is accustomed to going almost daily to the animal room with a shopping list of mice needed for 
experiments, it is hard to imagine that there had been a time when no inbred strains existed. It is even more 
difficult to envision how the world would have looked had inbred strains never been invented. Although the resourceful 
human mind would probably have found ways to eventually arrive at our present level of knowledge even without the 
strains, such an alternate course, no doubt, would have been much more arduous. Among the disciplines hardest hit 
by the lack of inbred strains would have been immunogenetics and, in particular, transplantation genetics. We would 
have learned about the existence of histocompatibility genes without the strains, but how we would have accumulated 
all the current knowledge about the individual genes, particularly the genes in the major histocompatibility complex, 
we cannot even guess. We are, therefore, happy to join in this tribute to the pioneers who initiated inbreeding of 
mouse strains. They have put into our hands a tool which for contemporary biology is as indispensable as the 
scintillation counter, the pH meter, or the Sephadex column. They have enabled the construction of new scientific 
disciplines probing into new territories of modern biology. For all this we are extremely grateful and it is our 
pleasure to share with them today some of the excitement that they have helped to generate.

<P>The work that we are going to describe started with inbred-strain analysis but it soon led us to the original 
source of all such strains -- the wild mice. It concerns the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex, the major histocompatibility complex of the mouse (
<a href="javascript:windowf491 = window.open('../figures/figure49-1.shtml', 'windowf491', 'width=1000,height=300,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf491.focus()">Figure 1</A>). 
When we began the work some ten years ago, Peter Gorer, Bernard Amos, Gustavo Hoecker, 
and George Snell had already established that among the inbred strains there were some ten alleles, or haplotypes 
as they are now referred to, at this complex locus (for review see reference 
<A HREF="#ref49-1">1</A>). This degree of genetic variability was surprising since only two or three alleles were known at 
all other loci identified at that time. Was this variability of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex a true polymorphism or was it 
merely the result of chance fixation? And if the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex was more polymorphic than other loci, what was 
then the meaning of the polymorphism, and how did the polymorphism relate to the function of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci? What was the function of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex anyway? These questions were provocative enough to stimulate our interest in the study of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> variability.

<A NAME="wild_H-2"></A>
<P><CENTER>Wild Mice Typing with Inbred Reagents</CENTER>

<P>The first step in this study was to trap wild mice in farm buildings, bring them into the laboratory, and type 
them with antisera defining individual antigens controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex. All such antisera available 
to us at that time were produced by crossimmunization of inbred strains and they defined H-2 antigens of the 
inbred strains. The typing of the wild mice with the antisera established two important facts, but provided only 
partial answers to our original questions (
<a href="javascript:windowf492 = window.open('../figures/figure49-2.shtml', 'windowf492', 'width=650,height=1100,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf492.focus()">Figure 2</A>). 
The two facts were, first, that some antisera were broadly reactive with wild mice, 
while others reacted with such mice hardly at all (
<A HREF="#ref49-2">2</A>), and second, that two mice from a single locality resembled each other in their H-2 antigens 
more closely than mice from different localities (
<A HREF="#ref49-3">3</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-4">4</A>). The broadly cross-reactive antisera were against H-2 antigens which were also shared by many 
inbred strains and which we therefore designated as public (
<A HREF="#ref49-2">2</A>). The reactivity pattern of these antisera suggested that the wild mice carried 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes different from those present in the inbred strains, but we could not be completely sure about this 
conclusion because it is the private(the most restricted antigen) that unambiguously characterizes a haplotype. 
The antisera tot eh private H-2 antigens reacted hardly at all with the wild mice, and if they did, it often turned 
out that the reactivity was caused by a previously undetected public antigen. When antibodies to the new antigen 
were removed by absorption, the antiserum ceased to react with the particular wild mouse while it still reacted 
with the inbred strain carrying the private antigen. It was a tantalizing finding: all we could get was a hint 
that wild mice possessed 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes absent in inbred strains, but we could neither prove this variability 
nor could we determine how many new haplotypes were present among the mice.

<P>The finding of locality-dependent diversification of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes was interesting and it fit well 
with observations made earlier by ecologists about the social structure of the mouse populations. Mice apparently 
live in small family units (demes) which are relatively isolated and migration from one unit to another is probably rare (
<A HREF="#ref49-5">5</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-6">6</A>). The similarity of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes within a single locality could be, therefore, the 
result of the genetic isolation of the families.

<A NAME="H-2_congenic"></A>
<P><CENTER>Production of B10.W Congenic Lines</CENTER>

<P>The ambiguity of wild-mice typing with antisera prepared against inbred 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes convinced us that the way of going about characterizing wild 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A>
haplotypes was to produce antisera against antigens controlled 
by these haplotypes. This may sound like a simple thing to do, but in fact there were problems with the approach. First 
of all, there was the question of how to get enough material for immunization. A single wild mouse was not going to 
provide enough tissue for the large number of injections necessary to produce an H-2 antiserum. Then, there was the 
problem of how to test the antiserum when the donor of the immunizing tissue was no longer available. And finally, 
we feared that immunization with so genetically heterogeneous a donor as the wild mouse would produce a mixture of 
antibodies that would take us forever to sort out.

<P>Because of these problems we decided to use a different approach. We resolved to isolate a sample of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes from wild mice and place them on the well-defined genetic background of an inbred strain. In other words, 
we wanted to do what George Snell did earlier with so many inbred 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes -- to produce 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
congenic lines. Because most of Snell's congenic lines were on the background of strain C57BL/10Sn, or B10 for short, 
we decided to use this strain for the crossing with wild mice, and to produce a series of B10.W congenic lines (where 
W stands for "wild"). It was then that we got the first taste of what it was like in the pioneering days of inbred 
and congenic strain production! For the task of producing 30 or 40 B10.W lines looks simple on paper, but in reality 
one has to overcome all kinds of mishaps to get the mice through the ten or 12 generations of backcrossing required 
for congenic line production. Now, more than ever, we can appreciate what was involved when the entire program of 
inbred-strain production was begun!

<P>To produce the B10.W lines, we took advantage of the fact that in the middle of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex is a locus coding for a serum protein, the serum serological substance or Ss (
<a href="javascript:windowf491 = window.open('../figures/figure49-1.shtml', 'windowf491', 'width=1000,height=300,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf491.focus()">Figure 1</A>, reference 
<A HREF="#ref49-7">7</A>). Because most wild mice carry the <I>Ss<SUP>h</SUP></I> allele at this locus, while some inbred 
strains carry the <I>Ss<SUP>l</SUP></I> allele, in the B10.W-production system we would backcross repeatedly to 
an <I>Ss<SUP>l</SUP> Ss<SUP>l</SUP></I> strain (B10.BR) and always select for further mating animals carrying the 
<I>Ss<SUP>h</SUP></I> allele and thus presumably the wild-derived alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci on both sides of <I>Ss</I> (
<a href="javascript:windowf493 = window.open('../figures/figure49-3.shtml', 'windowf493', 'width=650,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf493.focus()">Figure 3</A>).

<P>We started the project with some 80 B10. W lines; now, some ten years later, when the project is almost completed, 
we ended up with 35 lines. The others were all lost because of poor breeding performance.

<P><CENTER>Typing of B10.W Lines</CENTER>

<P>Once the production of the B10.W lines was completed, we took the next step -- to analyze their 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes. 
To this end we tested the lines with a battery of antisera defining all the known private H-2 antigens. We then immunized 
inbred strains [usually the (A x B10)F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids] with B10.W tissues, produced anti-B10.W sera, and tested the 
antisera against all inbred strains carrying different 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes, and against all other B10.W lines. Finally, 
we did an absorption analysis with all strains and all antisera that were positive in a direct test. The analysis consisted 
of absorbing each positive antiserum with each positive strain and testing on all positive strains. Although we tried to 
avoid the production of antibodies to public H-2 antigens in the anti-B10.W sera by choosing the A strain as one of the 
parents of the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid recipient (the <I>H-2<SUP>a</SUP></I> haplotype of strain A codes for most of the known 
public antigens), we were not completely successful. The broad cross-reactivity of the anti-B10.W indicated that there 
were many more public antigens than were previously defined and that wild mice carried a number of public antigens absent 
in inbred strains. Because we were interested only in antigens that characterize the new public antigens. On the contrary, 
we tried to remove the anti-public antibodies from our antisera and to restrict the reactivity pattern of the antisera 
as much as we could.

<A NAME="wild_T"></A>
<P>The analysis of all the B10.W strains has not been completed yet. Thus far, however, we have been able to identify 
20 new 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes and 25 new H-2 antigens (
<a href="javascript:windowt491 = window.open('../tables/table49-1.shtml', 'windowt491', 'width=1200,height=800,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt491.focus()">Table 1</A>), 
all of which are absent in the inbred strains (
<A HREF="#ref49-8">8</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-9">9</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-10">10</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-11">11</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-12">12</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref49-13">13</A>). We designated the new haplotypes <I>H-2<SUP>w1</SUP></I> through <I>H-2<SUP>w20</SUP></I> and the 
new antigens H-2.101 through H-2.125. In addition, we identified three new 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes in strains carrying alleles at the 
<I>t</I> locus (
<A HREF="#ref49-11">11</A>) which is positioned in the same chromosome as 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
and which affects embryonic and sperm development (
<A HREF="#ref49-14">14</A>). These haplotypes we designated according to the 
<I>t</I> 
allele they carry, that is, 
<I>H-2<SUP>twl</SUP></I>, 
<I>H-2<SUP>t12</SUP></I>, and 
<I>H-2<SUP>tw5</SUP></I>.

lists all of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes -- inbred or wild -- identified thus far. The total number is 109. Some of these haplotypes, however, share alleles at both 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> (they differ at other loci of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex not discussed in this communication). If we exclude these shared haplotypes, we still end up with an 
impressive number of 68 different haplotypes. Thus, among inbred strains and wild mice, 68 different combinations of alleles 
at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> loci have already been identified.

<P>Some of the haplotypes in 
<a href="javascript:windowt492 = window.open('../tables/table49-2.shtml', 'windowt492', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt492.focus()">Table 2</A> 
are recombinants, that is, they possess alleles at 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> or 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> 
loci also present in 
other haplotypes but in different combinations. Much of the variability of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex is thus generated by combinatorial means with alleles at the two 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci existing in many different combinations. Theoretically, the 
number of different <I>h-2K-H-2D</I> combinations equals the number of alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> 
locus multiplied by the number of alleles at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> 
locus. The alleles at the two loci are listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowt493 = window.open('../tables/table49-3.shtml', 'windowt493', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt493.focus()">Table 3</A>: 
there are 37 of them at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> 
locus and 32 at 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>. 
The total number of possible 
<I>H-2K-H-2D</I> combinations generated by the known alleles is, therefore, 1,184.

<P>As mentioned earlier, the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex contains several loci in addition to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>. The 
total number of loci composing the complex is not yet known, but ten loci have already been identified (
<a href="javascript:windowf491 = window.open('../figures/figure49-1.shtml', 'windowf491', 'width=1000,height=300,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf491.focus()">Figure 1</A>). 
Although most other 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci are probably far less polymorphic in comparison with 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>, 
they do contain multiple alleles. And so, even if one assumes that there are just a few alleles at other 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci, the number of possible 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes reaches almost astronomical proportions.

<P><CENTER>Determining Phenotypic Frequencies of H-2 Antigens</CENTER>

<P>The development of the B10.W lines was meant to be just a springboard for our analysis of wild mouse populations. Because 
the private inbred H-2 antigens were so poorly represented among wild mice, we hoped to identify private antigens of wild mice 
by means of our B10.W lines. As 
<a href="javascript:windowt491 = window.open('../tables/table49-1.shtml', 'windowt491', 'width=1200,height=800,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt491.focus()">Table 1</A> 
shows, we have succeeded in doing so. Once we produced antisera defining new private or semi-private 
H-2 antigens, we went back to wild mouse populations with this considerably enriched battery of typing reagents to determine 
the frequencies of individual H-2 antigens. This time the battery contained antisera against 36 H-2 antigens (
<a href="javascript:windowt494 = window.open('../tables/table49-4.shtml', 'windowt494', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt494.focus()">Table 4</A>), 
of which about one-half were characterized as private and the rest as semi-private (the latter 
being shared by a limited number of strains available to us).

<P>So far we have typed 70 wild mice, but the work continues and data on a much large panel should be available soon. The 
mice were trapped at the different localities in Texas, most of them in various farm buildings; only a few were trapped in 
the fields (One should bear in mind that the wild mice from which our B10.W lines were developed were trapped in Michigan 
and thus represented a geographically very distant population with regard to the Texas mice).

<P>To calculate phenotypic frequencies of the 36 H-2 antigens defined by our battery of antisera, we also used the panel 
of B10.W lines and took each line as a representative of one wild mouse. The total number of wild mice typed is therefore 
90 (70 trapped mice and 20 B10.W lines).

<P>The calculations of phenotypic frequencies were carried out by dividing the number of mice typed as positive for a 
given antigen by the number of mice tested (
<A HREF="#ref49-90">90</A>). The frequencies calculated in this manner are subject to several qualifications.

<P>In the first place, we ignored the fact the groups of mice came from the same localities and that the presence in a 
given locality of several mice positive for a given antigen probably reflected close blood-relationship among such mice. The 
justification for ignoring the origin of the mice was our hope that in a large sample covering wide geographical area the 
local effects on antigen frequencies would be minimized. However, the sample described here might not have been large enough 
and local effects might have biased our antigen-frequency calculations.

<P>In the second place, we did not take into consideration the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
zygosity of the wild mice. A mouse typed as negative for a given antigen does not pose any problem in this respect, 
but a positive mouse could be either homo- or heterozygous for the antigen. We are in a process of establishing the frequency of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
heterozygosity among wild mice and once we have the figure, we should be able to use it as a correction factor in our frequency estimates. For the calculations in 
<a href="javascript:windowt494 = window.open('../tables/table49-4.shtml', 'windowt494', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt494.focus()">Table 4</A>, 
such a factor has not yet been introduced and the data should be therefore viewed with this fact 
in mind. It is also important to realize that the data in 
<a href="javascript:windowt494 = window.open('../tables/table49-4.shtml', 'windowt494', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt494.focus()">Table 4</A> 
represent <U>phenotypic</U> and not gene frequencies.

<P>The third qualification concerns the pooling of data on wild mice and B10.W line typing. Each B10.W line is, in fact, 
not equivalent to one wild mouse because it carries only one of the two 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotypes of the original wild mouse 
from which it was derived. Consequently, by typing wild mice we test for two haplotypes (provided that the mouse is an 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
heterozygote), while by typing B10.W lines we test for only one haplotype. However, since in most instances 
the antigen frequencies calculated separately for wild mice and B10.W lines do not differ significantly, the pooling of 
the data is probably justified.

<P>The last qualification concerns the specificity of the reagents in the typing battery. Each antiserum, before it was 
included in the battery, was extensively analyzed against panels of inbred strains and B10.W lines and absorbed so that 
it reacted only against a given antigen, but we could never be sure that it did not contain additional antibodies. Such 
antibodies might have escaped our detection when the antiserum was tested against the strain panels, but they might have 
emerged when the serum was tested on wild mice. In one or two instances we know that this actually did happen. For example, 
antiserum detecting antigen H-2.16 was monospecific in our panel tests, that is, it reacted only with strains carrying H-2.16 
and no other mice. But when  the antiserum was tested against our sample of 70 wild mice, it reacted with an unexpectedly 
high number of them. Furthermore, some mice positive with this antiserum were also positive for several other private H-2 
antigens and this observations, of course, aroused our suspicion that the anti-H-2.16 might not be monospecific after all. 
And indeed, when the antiserum was absorbed by some of the positive wild mice, the reactivity against these mice was removed 
but the serum still reacted with H-2.16 positive strains. Apparently, despite all efforts to make it monospecific, the 
antiserum still contained at least two antibodies, one against antigen H-2.16 and another against a public antigen which is 
present in H-2.16-positive strains and some wild mice, but absent in all other strains in our typing panels. Once we had 
learned about the second antibody, we made sure that for future testing an anti-H-2.16 serum was used from which the antibody 
was absorbed out, but we of course could not tell how many of the previously typed positive wild mice actually carried H-2.16 
and how many reacted with the antiserum because of the presence of the previously unidentified antibody to the public antigen. 
We solved this problem by ignoring the results obtained with the antiserum before its complexity was discovered.

<P>This example, however, raises the question of how many of our other typing antisera are complex in a similar way. To answer 
this question we would have to do absorption analysis with each positive mouse, but such analysis with so many reagents and 
so many mice to test is not humanly possible. We do, however, spot check all the antisera by absorbing them with wild mice and 
testing them for their monospecificity, and we check, of course, all antisera for additional antibodies when our suspicion is 
aroused. But despite all these precautions, one must first consider the antigen-frequency data in 
<a href="javascript:windowt494 = window.open('../tables/table49-4.shtml', 'windowt494', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt494.focus()">Table 4</A> 
as possibly overestimated. The frequencies of at least some of the antigens might be actually lower 
than our preliminary data indicate.

<P><CENTER>Evaluation of H-2 Antigen Frequencies</CENTER>

<P>Among the private H-2 antigens in 
<a href="javascript:windowt494 = window.open('../tables/table49-4.shtml', 'windowt494', 'width=600,height=900,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt494.focus()">Table 4</A> 
the following are detected by antisera which we have no reason 
to suspect as containing more than one antibody: H-2.2, 4, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 106, 108, 109, 
110, 111, 112, 113, and 114. The other antigens are either semi-private ones or antigens defined by antisera that might 
contain additional antibodies. Several points can be made about these preliminary data.

<P>The most frequent among the "clean" private antigens is H-2.31 which was found in six wild mice and three B10.W strains 
(phenotypic frequency of some 10%). At the opposite end of this scale are antigens H-2.15 and H-2.18 which we have not found 
in any of the typed wild mice and which are also absent in all the B10.W lines. The antigens are carried by inbred strains 
and one might speculate that these strains were derived from wild mice unrelated to the population of wild mice that we 
are currently typing.

<P>The majority of the clean private antigens occur in the Texas wild mice and in the B10.W lines with frequencies ranging 
from 1 to 5%. If we assume -- as our data suggest -- that aside from H-2.31, there are not very many frequently occurring 
H-2 antigens and that the average H-2 antigen frequency is 2%, then we may estimate that the population we are presently 
testing may contain some 50 antigens controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> 
locus and another 50 antigens controlled by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> 
locus. Barring linkage disequilibrium, these numbers would then lead to the estimate of 50<SUP>2</SUP> or 2,500 haplotypes 
(or more precisely <I>H-2K-H-2D</I> allelic combinations).

<P>It is interesting to compare these estimates with the frequencies of antigens controlled by the human homologue of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex -- the <I>HLA</I> system. There are now some 15 antigens known to be controlled by the <I>HLA-A</I> locus 
and another 20 antigens controlled by the <I>HLA-B</I> locus (
<A HREF="#ref49-15">15</A>). About half of these HLA antigens occur in frequencies similar to the phenotypic frequency of H-2.31 
(<I>i.e.</I>, 10 to 20%), while the other half of <I>HLA</I> antigens occurs in frequencies of 5% or less, that is, frequencies 
similar to those of the majority of H-2 antigens. In other words, in the <I>HLA</I> system there seem to be more antigens 
occurring in high frequencies than in the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex. This difference between the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
and <I>HLA</I> systems 
could mean one of two things: either some of the HLA antisera defining the more common antigens are not truly monospecific 
and the difference between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
and <I>HLA</I> is the consequence of differences in methodologies, or the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex is more polymorphic than the <I>HLA</I> system.

<P>Some 43% of the wild mice in our sample failed to react with any of the antisera in our battery. These "blanks" indicate 
the presence in the wild mice of H-2 antigens against which we have not yet made antisera. Thus there are probably more 
antigens than we have been able to identify so far, and search for these antigens is in progress.

<P>One can also expect that mice from other parts of the world might have still different antigens. A comparison of North 
American, European, and Asiatic mice might provide some interesting results in this respect.

<P><CENTER>CONCLUSION</CENTER>

<P>In addition to providing, for the first time, information about H-2 antigen frequencies and about the extent of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
polymorphisms, our wild mice studies are proving to be useful in other areas of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
immunogenetics, primarily as a source of new 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
variants. Several of our B10.W lines turned out to be 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
recombinants, carrying haplotypes that are 
new combinations of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:3040519" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:1933561" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A> 
alleles present in other strains. Such an enrichment of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> recombinant 
collection should be helpful for all kinds of H-2 mapping studies.

<P>Other B10.W strains seem to carry alleles which are similar to but not identical with alleles carried by other strains. The 
difference between these alleles is very likely the consequence of recent mutations. Comparison -- particularly a biochemical 
one -- of such natural variants should provide much needed information as to how the variability of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
loci is generated.

<P>And so in our studies we have traveled the full circle: we began with inbred strains, extended from there to wild mice, 
and now with our B10.W lines we have come back to inbred strains again. And we have been able to travel the circle in such a 
relatively short time only because we has a solid foundations in the lines produced by the fathers of mouse inbreeding.
