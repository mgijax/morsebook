<P>Progress in transplantation immunogenetics has depended heavily on the development of inbred mouse strains. The earliest observations 
indicating that acceptance of allografts was at least partially heritable were made in closed mouse colonies. With the production of inbred 
mouse strains, the basic principles of transplantation immunogenetics developed more readily: outstanding examples were the finding that 
the acceptance of allografts is a polygenic trait, and that histocompatibility genes can be isolated in congenic strain pairs.

<P>Since the present report will deal with histocompatibility genes and their antigens, particularly the minor histocompatibility genes and 
antigens, it would be appropriate to define these terms. Histocompatibility antigens (H-antigens) are found on a broad distribution of tissues 
and immunological reaction against them results in the rejection of antigen-bearing tissues. This definition excludes tissue-specific antigens 
such as the blood group antigens (the Ea series in the mouse) and the lymphocyte antigens (the Ly series in the mouse). In addition, it excludes 
modulating antigens -- antigens that evoke immunological reactions not resulting in tissue rejection (TL in the mouse). The term minor H-antigen 
is complementary to the term major H-antigen. The major H-antigens are under the genetic control of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A>  
complex, a group of closely linked genes on chromosome 17. The minor H-antigens are controlled by genes scattered throughout the remainder 
of the chromosomes in addition to four genes located on chromosome 17.

<P><CENTER>Estimates of the Number of H-Loci</CENTER>

<P>The role of genetics in transplantation was first suggested by Loeb (
<A HREF="#ref24-1">1</A>) and Tyzzer (
<A HREF="#ref24-2">2</A>), but it remained for Little (
<A HREF="#ref24-3">3</A>) in his classical publication, "A Possible Mendelian Explanation for a Type of Inheritance Apparently Non-Mendelian in Nature," 
to hypothesize that the susceptibility or resistance to the growth of an allograft was under the control of multiple genes, subsequently named 
histocompatibility genes by Snell (
<A HREF="#ref24-4">4</A>). In a later publication, Little and Tyzzer (
<A HREF="#ref24-5">5</A>) produced F<SUB>2</SUB> mice from the initial cross of a Japanese waltzing mouse and a common house mouse. They used the 
acceptance or rejection of a Japanese waltzing mouse tumor by the F<SUB>2</SUB> mice to estimate that the Japanese waltzing mouse and the 
common house mouse differed by 14-15 H-genes. The technique suffered from two shortcomings: 1) because of the large number of H-genes by 
which the parental strains differed, very few grafts were accepted and the resultant error was great, and 2) the technique allowed only 
one opportunity for crossover; therefore multiple closely linked H-genes behaved as one gene. Bailey and Mobraaten (
<A HREF="#ref24-6">6</A>) minimized these two shortcomings by basing their estimates on the survival of skin grafted between partially inbred 
mice and from multiple backcrossed mice to parental strain mice. In both cases the number of surviving skin grafts and the opportunities 
for crossovers are increased manyfold. Using these techniques Bailey and Mobraaten estimated that strains BALB/cBy and C57BL/6By differ 
by 28 or 29 H-genes.

<P>To determine if Bailey's estimate, which was significantly larger than previous estimates, was typical of other strain combinations, we 
have tested additional strain pairs. We used the multiple backcross technique to estimate the number of genes by which DBA/2J and B10.D2 
differ (these two strains both possess the <I>H-2<SUP>d</SUP></I> haplotype). These strains were crossed and female offspring backcrossed 
to B10.D2 males for multiple generations. Skin was grafted to B10.D2 males from females of backcross generations N4 through N8. If the skin 
grafts were not rejected within 100 days, whenever possible a second B10.D2 male was immunized with 5 x 10<SUP>6</SUP> spleen cells from 
the female donor, skin grafted, and scored for 250 days. The formula L = s<SUP>n-1</SUP> was used to estimate the number of histocompatibility 
differences between DBA/2J and B10.D2 (L = number of H-genes, n = the generation in which all grafts of a given line were accepted). Based 
on the responses of unimmunized hosts an H-gene difference of 28 genes was estimated. Based on the responses of immunized hosts an H-gene 
difference of 63 genes was estimated. In order to estimate the number of H-differences by which C57BL/6J and DBA/2J differ, orthotopic tail 
skin grafts were exchanged between unimmunized, sex-matched, full siblings of 16 sublines derived from a C57BL/6J-DBA/2J cross. These sublines 
had been through 13 to 17 sibling matings. The grafts were scored for 100 days. Using the formula S = (3/4)<SUP>rL</SUP> (5/8)<SUP>vL</SUP> 
(S = surviving fraction, r and v are constants dependent on the generation number), it was estimated that these strains differed by 34 H-genes 
(28 in males, 39 in females) (
<A HREF="#ref24-7">7</A>). Similarly the number of H-genes by which C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ differ was estimated to be 32 (37 in males, 27 in females) (
<A HREF="#ref24-7">7</A>). These results for strain combinations B10.D2 - DBA/2J, C57BL/6J - DBA/2J, and C57BL/6J - C3H/HeJ are of the same order of 
magnitude as Bailey's estimate for C57BL/6By - BALB/cBy. It is likely that the counts of 28 to 34 for histocompatibility differences between 
unrelated strains are representative.

<P>Estimates of the total number of H-genes also can be made from the frequency of H-gene mutations, Based on the ratio of H-gene mutation 
(as determined by rejection of skin grafts exchanged between F<SUB>1</SUB>'s) to the mutation rate of other genes, Bailey (
<A HREF="#ref24-8">8</A>) estimated a total of 720 H-genes. By another method, based on lost type mutations and the number of H-gene differences 
between the strains being tested, he estimated 430 H-genes. Bailey explained extremely large estimates by the facts that they reflect 
non-polymorphic (silent) as well as polymorphic H-loci, that they are not dependent on gene segregation and thereby not affected by linkage, 
and that there may be more than one mutation site at each locus.

<A NAME="listing"></A>
<P>It was possible to identify and study the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
locus in inbred mouse strains which differed by many non-<I>H-2</I> loci as well as by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> locus because of the strength of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
antigens and because specific antibodies could be produced against H-2 antigens which could then be used for identification. The 
relative weakness of the non-H-2 antigens and their failure to stimulate good antisera has necessitated the isolation of non-
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A>  genes in congenic mouse strains for identification. Through the use of congenic strains 35 minor histocompatibility loci have been 
reported in addition to loci on the X and Y chromosomes (the latter two not requiring congenic strains).

<P><CENTER>The Cellular Immune Response to Non-H-2 Antigens</CENTER>

<P>The most frequently used technique to study the cellular immune response to non-H-2 antigens has been allograft rejection. The first 
allografts to be used were tumor, which proved to be a technically easy but insensitive test. Skin grafting techniques were found to be 
more sensitive because the hosts could be observed for rejection for prolonged periods, whereas tumor recipients would have succumbed. Two 
major techniques of skin grafting have been used, the grafting of skin onto the flank (
<A HREF="#ref24-27">27</A>) and the grafting of tail skin orthotopically (
<A HREF="#ref24-28">28</A>). Median survival times (MST's) tend to be shorter with the orthotopic tail skin technique, probably because the grafts are smaller.

<P>The magnitude of the immune response by a particular host to a given antigen depends on the degree of "differentness" of the antigen 
(immunogenicity) and the immune responsiveness of the host. Data are being accumulated documenting variation in host responsiveness to 
a given antigen. In 1969 Graff and Snell (
<A HREF="#ref24-26">26</A>) noted a variation in the immune capability of a group of F<SUB>1</SUB> mice as indicated by their ability to reject 
non-<I>H-2</I> disparate skin grafts. Subsequent studies have indicated that genes in the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex control the speeds of rejection of non-<I>H-2</I> disparate skin grafts. The immune response to H-Y by female mice has been shown to be under the control of an 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A>-linked gene (
<A HREF="#ref24-29">29</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref24-30">30</A>). To study the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A>-linked genetic control of immune responsiveness to non-H-2 antigens, Wettstein and Haughton 
are producing groups of "double congenic" strains. These strains are developed in groups of at least four strains. All of the strains are 
on a C57BL/10 background, two of the strains share one 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> haplotype and differ at a given non-<I>H-2</I> locus, and the 
other two share a second 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> haplotype and possess the same non-<I>H-2</I> difference. With these groups of double congenic mice, 
Wettstein and Haughton (
<A HREF="#ref24-31">31</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref24-32">32</A>) have demonstrated that the magnitude of the allograft rejection reaction against the H-4.2 and H-7.2 antigens is effected by the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> haplotype of the host, indicating the existence of immune response genes in the <I>H-2</I> complex. Through the use of 
crossover strains it appears that the immune response genes for different non-H-2 antigens may be located in different places in the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> complex.

<A NAME="immunogenicity"></A>
<P>To properly study the immunogenicity of histocompatibility antigens, variations in host immune responsiveness must be minimized. This can most 
effectively be accomplished by using only one host strain in a given experiment. If this is not possible, one should use host strains with a 
common background and preferably the same 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
haplotype. The subsequently described studies have been carried out with these guidelines 
in mind. The total immunogenicity (as indicated by skin allograft rejection) of the antigens of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> complex plus adjacent histocompatibility 
genes has been shown to be about equal to the cumulative non-H-2 immunogenicity (
<a href="javascript:windowt243 = window.open('../tables/table24-3.shtml', 'windowt243', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt243.focus()">Table 3</A>). 
The individual non-H-2 antigens are weaker, falling on a continuum from the strong H-4<SUP>b</SUP> antigen (which is 
slightly weaker than H-2D) to the extremely weak H-9 antigens. Great variations exist in the strengths of the antigens controlled by the alleles 
of many of the loci (
<a href="javascript:windowt243 = window.open('../tables/table24-3.shtml', 'windowt243', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt243.focus()">Table 3</A>) (
<A HREF="#ref24-20">20</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref24-21">21</A>). As data accumulate on the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex, it is apparent that the "H-2 immunogenicity" is really the cumulative immunogenicity 
of multiple histocompatibility antigens. In addition to the immunogenicity of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95904" target="_blank"><I>H-2K</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95895" target="_blank"><I>H-2A</I></A>, <I>H-2C</I>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95896" target="_blank"><I>H-2D</I></A>, there are now added 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95979" target="_blank"><I>H-31</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95980" target="_blank"><I>H-32</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95981" target="_blank"><I>H-33</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:106031" target="_blank"><I>H-39</I></A>. It would appear 
that when the appropriate crossover and congenic strains are produced the immunogenicity of the individual antigens of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex and adjacent genes may prove to be comparable to that of the individual non-H-2 antigens.

<P>To quantitate more accurately the cellular immune response to histocompatibility antigens of varying strengths, B10.A mice were injected with 
varying numbers of lymphocytes differing at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
locus, and C57BL/10Sn mice were injected with varying numbers of lymphocytes differing at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95977" target="_blank"><I>H-3</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95993" target="_blank"><I>H-4</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96006" target="_blank"><I>H-7</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95886" target="_blank"><I>H-13</I></A> 
loci. The B10.A and C57BL/10Sn mice were then grafted with skin from the lymphocyte 
donors at varying intervals thereafter. The speed of rejection of the skin grafts was taken as an indication of the level of immunity. A first 
set rejection was taken to indicate that the antigen dose was too small to be recognized (a subthreshold dose); a second set rejection was taken 
to indicate that an immunizing dose had been given; prolonged survival was taken to indicate that the immune system had been overwhelmed (I avoid 
the word "tolerance" because I wish to make no implications concerning mechanism). The responses of mice tested one week after antigen challenge 
indicated that the ability to immunize and overwhelm relates directly to immunogenicity: the weaker the antigen, the larger the amount of antigen 
needed to immunize and the smaller the amount of antigen needed to overwhelm. With H-2 antigens and the strongest non-H-2 antigens, small doses of 
allogenic lymphocytes sensitized (as indicated by accelerated rejection of subsequent skin grafts) and the largest doses used did not produce 
non-reactivity. With weaker antigens the threshold immunizing dose increased and the dose producing non-reactivity decreased until, with extremely 
weak antigens, no single dose sensitized and relatively small numbers of cells overwhelmed (
<A HREF="#ref24-33">33</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref24-34">34</A>).

<P>Following the injection of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
disparate lymphocytes the immune response to the H-2 antigen was apparent one day later, peaked three 
days later, and waned 14 days later, persisting in a low grade manner for 98 days. Following the injection of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95993" target="_blank"><I>H-4</I></A> disparate lymphocytes the 
immune response to the H-4 antigens appeared two days later, peaked four days later, and waned at 14 days, persisting at a moderate level until 
98 days. Following the injection of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96006" target="_blank"><I>H-7</I></A> 
disparate lymphocytes the immune response to the H-7 antigen first appeared seven days later and reached a 
persistent maximum at 28 days, persisting at that high level for 98 days. Following the injection of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95886" target="_blank"><I>H-13</I></A> disparate lymphocytes the immune response 
to the H-13 antigen was suppressed for 14 days. Immunity first appeared 35 days after injection and disappeared by day 56 (
<a href="javascript:windowf242 = window.open('../figures/figure24-2.shtml', 'windowf242', 'width=800,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf242.focus()">Figure 2</A>). 
This assay has the limitation of being very slow (the length of the assay is the duration of the graft survival time) and 
relatively inaccurate in estimating latency. Nevertheless, comparisons between the patterns of the responses to antigens of different strengths 
can be made. Clearly, the weaker the antigen the longer the latent period. As in previous studies of Snell <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref24-35">35</A>) using Winn's assay, strong cellular immunity to H-2 antigens is short lived. If cellular immunity persists at a high level only 
as long as antigen is present, the short duration of strong cellular immunity against H-2 antigens and the long duration of cellular immunity 
against H-4 and H-7 antigens may reflect the rate of clearance of the antigen. The fluctuating response against the weak H-13 antigen probably 
reflects the small size of the clone capable of responding.

<P>The immunogenicity of transplantation antigens can be cumulative under some circumstances and not cumulative under others. The immunogenic 
relationship between multiple transplantation antigens on a single cell has been studied using congenic strains differing at one or more <I>H</I>-loci (
<A HREF="#ref24-36">36</A>). The immune response against a cell containing two antigens theoretically can be directed at either or both antigens; if the 
magnitude of the immune response against both antigens is no stronger than the magnitude of the response to the stronger antigen alone, then it 
can be said that the weaker antigen has made no contribution to total immunogenicity and there is no cumulative effect. if, however, the magnitude 
of the response to the double difference is stronger than the response to the stronger antigen alone, then it can be stated that there is a cumulative 
effect. When grafts were exchanged between strains differing by two loci, the greatest cumulative effects were noted when the rejection rates were 
of similar magnitudes. If the immunogenicities of the individual antigens were different, no cumulative effect was noted. If a third antigen was 
added to two others, its immunogenicity contributed only if there was a similarity in the rates of rejection of the single and double differences. 
It would appear that if one continues to add weaker antigens, they would be cumulative only as long as the rate of rejection of the multiple differences 
was sufficiently similar to the rate of rejection of the last antigen to be added. Although B10.D2 and DBA/2 differ by about 34 minor H-antigens, it 
is probable that only the two or three of the strongest antigens affect the magnitude of the immune response. These observations held true whether 
H-2 antigens were involved or not. The mechanism of the cumulative effect is not known. It has been hypothesized (
<A HREF="#ref24-36">36</A>) that if two antigens of disparate immunogenicity existed on the same cell, the stronger antigen would lead to sensitization and 
cell destruction before the weak antigen could trigger an immune response in its clone. If the immunogenicities were similar, both clones would be 
triggered. Nothing is known about the mechanisms of immunologic destruction of cells bearing single antigenic differences versus cells bearing 
multiple differences. The observed results can be explained on the basis of independent action on each antigen. This does not mean that an effect 
beyond this independent action does not exist (
<A HREF="#ref24-37">37</A>).

<P>The H-2 antigens elicit near-maximal responses which obliterate many characteristics of allograft rejection that are apparent with the weaker 
responses to non-H-2 antigens. Although the size of grafts exchanged across H-2 barriers does not affect graft rejection, the size of grafts exchanged 
across non-H-2 barriers does. Both the ability to sensitize and the time required for graft destruction are size dependent with larger grafts sensitizing 
more rapidly and taking longer to reject (
<A HREF="#ref24-38">38</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref24-39">39</A>). Rejection of grafts from hemi-allogeneic donors occurs significantly more slowly that rejection of grafts from totally allogeneic donors (
<A HREF="#ref24-40">40</A>). These observations tend to indicate that both the affector and the effector mechanisms are dose dependent. The female immune response is 
often stronger than the male response to the same antigen (reviewed in 
<A HREF="#ref24-41">41</A>). This is quite apparent in the immune response to many non-H-2 antigens as indicated by shorter MST's in females than in males. This 
difference is obliterated following gonadectomy and adrenalectomy. In fact, the strength of male rejection and to a lesser extent the strength of female 
rejection were greater than the strength of unaltered mice. It has been hypothesized that the strengthened immune response was due to the removal of 
endogenous immunosuppressive adrenal and gonadal steroids and that the difference between male and female rejection times was due to quantitative and 
qualitative differences in the endogenous male and female adrenal and gonadal steroids.

<P><CENTER><I>In Vitro</I> Assays for Non-H-2 Antigens</CENTER>

<P>Until recently, <I>in vitro</I> assays generally have been unsuccessful in demonstrating non-H-2 antigens. Perhaps as a result of improved technology, 
positive results have been obtained. Tests using humoral immune techniques to demonstrate non-H-2 transplantation antigens have rarely been successful. Winn, Stevens, and Snell (
<A HREF="#ref24-42">42</A>) produced hemolytic antibodies directed against H-1 and H-3 antigens. Snell and Graff (unpublished data) produced monospecific 
hemagglutinating antibodies directed against H-1 and H-7 by exchanging skin grafts between congenic strains differing by these genes and, following rejection, 
injecting donor strain lymphocytes. The hemagglutinating antibodies produced had extremely high titers but lost activity rapidly following freezing. 
Subsequent attempts to produce these antisera were unsuccessful. Zink and Heyner (
<A HREF="#ref24-43">43</A>) produced polyspecific non-H-2 antisera by injecting B10.D2/n spleen and lymph node cells into (BALB/cJxDBA/2J)F<SUB>1</SUB> mice. 
Anti H-3 and H-8 activity was demonstrated using hemagglutination, immunofluorescence, and mixed hemabsorption techniques with B10.LP-<I>a</I> and B10.D2(57N) 
target cells, respectively. It is of particular note that none of these studies have been able to demonstrate lymphocytotoxic activity. 
The indirect radioimmunoassay has been used successfully to demonstrate TL antigen (
<A HREF="#ref24-44">44</A>) and tumor-specific antigens (
<A HREF="#ref24-45">45</A>). In pilot studies in our laboratory target cells were reacted with putative antisera and either <SUP>125</SUP>I-labeled 
goat-anti-mouse globulin or <SUP>125</SUP>I-labeled staphylococcal protein A as binding agents. Although early studies were encouraging, we have not yet 
succeeded in applying this technique to non-H-2 antigens.

<P>Although Mangi and Mardiney (
<A HREF="#ref24-46">46</A>) have reported weak mixed lymphocyte reaction to individual non-H-2 antigens, most investigators have been unsuccessful in 
doing so. Recent personal communications have indicated success (Wettstein personal communication) and failure (Dunlop, personal communication) with 
this technique. The cell-mediated lysis (CML) assay has proven more effective, Gordon <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref24-47">47</A>) using CML against the H-Y antigen and Bevan (
<A HREF="#ref24-48">48</A>) using CML against H-3, H-13, H-7, and H-8 antigens.


<P><CENTER>CONCLUSION</CENTER>

<P>In summary, many polymorphic cell membrane structures under the control of multiple genes scattered throughout the genome are specifically 
recognizable by the immune system. Although these structures are collectively called by the name histocompatibility antigens, and the controlling 
genes are collectively called by the name histocompatibility genes, they may have no more in common than being membrane structures that are 
immunologically recognizable. Actually we know nothing about the functions of these structures, which may be different from one another and 
different from the functioning of the antigens of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex. Although these studies were stimulated by a need to know about 
allograft rejection and histoincompatibility, the knowledge gained may have greater implications for cell biology in general and the function 
of the cell membrane specifically.
