<H2>Genetic Heterogeneity of Spanish House Mice (<I>Mus musculus</I> Complex)<SUP>

<P>In 1943, Schwartz and Schwartz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>) published a summary of the their extensive studies on the systematics of the house mouse, <I>Mus musculus</I> L. 
In their view, the house mouse was one species comprised of several recognizable subspecific units. These subspecies exhibited 
distinctive morphological features and ecological behavior. The biogeographical history of these units was seen as a series of 
wild forms giving rise to populations of commensal types associated with the first agricultural civilizations of man that developed 
throughout the Palearctic region. This interpretation was accepted for many years, in spite of the problem in Europe where often 
two phenotypically distinctive types (<I>i.e.</I>, subspecies) of mice can be found living in the same area (
<A HREF="#ref42-2">2</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref42-3">3</A>). The sympatry of subspecies runs of counter to the modern paradigm of the biological-species concept (
<A HREF="#ref42-4">4</A>). Under this construct, subspecies are considered as geographically separated populations of individuals that are 
reproductively compatible among themselves. This discrete phenotypic classes in one region would not be expected because of the 
dilution effects of interbreeding. An alternate, but unlikely, explanation for the presence of two sympatric phenotypes of one 
species might be the existence of an ecological and morphological polymorphism, such as described for cichlid fishes (
<A HREF="#ref42-5">5</A>).

<A NAME="spanish"></A><A NAME="brevirostris"></A><A NAME="spretus"></A>
<P>In the interest of learning more about the genetic structure of house mouse populations where two subspecies were said to coexist, 
I collected samples from several localities in Spain. Here <I>M. m. brevirostris</I> Waterhouse (1837) and <I>M. m. spretus</I> Lataste 
(1883) (following the nomenclature of 1) were said to occur in sympatry throughout most of the Iberian peninsula. In this paper I 
describe the results of an electrophoretic study of the proteins of these animals. Mice collected in England and animals from an 
inbred lab strain served as outside reference samples. A more detailed report on the morphology and karyology of the wild animals is in preparation.

<P><CENTER>Nomenclature of Spanish Mice</CENTER>

<A NAME="hispanicus"></A>
<P>Electrophoretic analysis clearly demonstrated that two species of <I>Mus</I> are present in Spain. They live together at many localities 
and show no evidence of exchanging genes through interbreeding. This directly invalidates the classification scheme of Schwarz and Schwarz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>), thereby requiring a revised nomenclature in referring to these animals. For the moment the use of the name <I>M. musculus</I> 
for the commensal form is appropriate. However, the use of the name <I>M. spretus</I> for the aboriginal mice [terminology of Bruell (
<A HREF="#ref42-6">6</A>)] in Spain does not seem to be correct. Originally these Spanish animals were described as the subspecies 
<I>M. spicilegus hispanicus</I> by Miller (
<A HREF="#ref42-7">7</A>). The nominate form, <I>M. s. spicilegus</I>, occurs in eastern Europe and to some unknown distance into southern Russia [see Serafinski (
<A HREF="#ref42-8">8</A>) for another opinion about these taxa). There is presently a hiatus of nearly one thousand kilometers between the ranges 
of these aboriginal mice. Zoogeographical considerations suggest that the Iberian form is unlikely to be closely related to this more continental, 
interior population. Schwarz and Schwarz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>), however, considered these animals to be related to the form <I>M. m. spretus</I> of northern Algeria. Zoogeographically this 
inferred relationship is more probable as many other Spanish species show similar relationships to the North African fauna. However, the 
Spanish mammalogist Cabrera, who knew the aboriginal mice in Spain to be a different species from the sympatric commensal mice, presented evidence (
<A HREF="#ref42-9">9</A>), including four features of pelage color, body size and dentition, that demonstrated the distinctiveness of the Algerian 
<I>spretus</I> animals from Spanish and Moroccan mice that he had trapped and considered closely related. For these reasons it seems that 
the Spanish aboriginal mouse should be considered a species distinct from other <I>Mus</I> populations to the east and south. <I>Mus hispanicus</I> (
<A HREF="#ref42-7">7</A>) appears to be the oldest name referring specifically to these animals, and I will employ this name in the remainder of the paper.

<P><CENTER>MATERIALS AND METHODS</CENTER>

<P>During September 1977, 88 mice were trapped at six localities (
<a href="javascript:windowf421 = window.open('../figures/figure42-1.shtml', 'windowf421', 'width=650,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf421.focus()">Figure 1</A>): 
1) England, Berkshire, <U>Abingdon</U>, Culham College ( 8 <I>M. musculus</I>); 2) Spain, Catalunya, <U>Puigcerd&#225;</U>, 110 km NNW Barcelona 
(2 <I>M. musculus</I>); 3) Spain, Catalunya, <U>Balenya</U>, 46 kn NNE Barcelona (11 <I>M. musculus</I>, 40 <I>M. hispanicus</I>); 4) Spain, Catalunya, 
<U>San Fausto</U>, 10 km NE Barcelona (3 <I>M. musculus</I>); 5) Spain, Catalunya, <U>Barcelona</U> (6 <I>M. musculus</I>); and 6) Spain, Andalucia, 
<U>Puerto Real</U> (0-16 km E), 10+ km E Cadiz ( 1 <I>M. musculus</I>, 17 <I>M. hispanicus</I>). Both snap traps and Sherman live traps were placed 
in various types of human habitations, in agricultural fields, and in natural environments. Captured animals were weighed and measured using standard 
procedures (
<A HREF="#ref42-10">10</A>). For all individuals the heart, liver, kidneys, and a piece of leg muscle were saved. The testes and epididymides were taken 
from all adult males. Blood was collected in heparinized tubes from some specimens which were caught alive. Red cells were allowed to settle 
before removing plasma. The cells were then washed once or twice with an isotonic saline solution. Tissues and blood samples were stored during 
the field work in liquid nitrogen (-196&#176;C). In the laboratory, the tissue samples and resultant extracts were maintained frozen at -76&#176;C. 
Extracts were prepared by mincing the tissue with scissors, adding approximately an equal amount of deionized water to the material, and centrifuging 
at 27,000 x g for 40 minutes. The heart-kidneys (Ht+K) and testes-epididymides (T+E) were made into pooled extracts, but the other materials were kept 
as monospecific samples. Horizontal starch gel electrophoresis was carried out following the general procedures described in (
<A HREF="#ref42-11">11</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref42-12">12</A>). The staining recipes were similar to those described in these preceding two references. Electrostarch (O. Hiller, Madison, Wisconsin) 
was used throughout the study. Starch from Lot 302 was used in assaying the lactate dehydrogenase and diaphorase loci, and Lot 307 was used in the 
rest of the work. The buffer systems and electrophoresis conditions used are identified in 
<a href="javascript:windowt421 = window.open('../tables/table42-1.shtml', 'windowt421', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt421.focus()">Table 1</A>.

<P>Tissue extracts were prepared from C57BL mice obtained from the University of California Cancer Research Laboratory. The allelomorphic classes shown 
at all loci from these samples were used as standards of comparison for the rest of the material. Relative mobility of non-standard allelomorphs was 
measured by dividing the absolute mobility distance of the variant allele from the origin by the distance moved by the standard on the same gel. This 
quotient was used to designate all of the mobility class allelomorphs that were found during the study. An extract of liver and kidney mitochondria was 
prepared from C57BL mice (
<A HREF="#ref42-13">13</A>) and used to identify enzymes bound to these subcellular structures.

<P>Samples of testes, plasma, and hemolysates were unavailable for all specimens, thus loci surveyed from these tissues or blood components 
are represented by a smaller number of genes than stated in the sample size column of 
<a href="javascript:windowt423 = window.open('../tables/table42-3.shtml', 'windowt423', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt423.focus()">Table 3</A>. 
The numbers of animals surveyed for loci from these extracts are as follows: <I>M. musculus</I>, 
locality 1 (T+E=4, P=4, H=3); 
locality 2 (T+E=1, P=2, H=2); 
locality 3 (T+E=3, P=6, H=3); 
locality 4 (T+E=2, P=1); 
locality 5 (T+E=2, P=2); 
locality 6 (T+E=1); and for <I>M. hispanicus</I>, 
locality 5 (T+E=13, P=5, H=5); 
locality 6 (T+E=4, P=3, H=8). To include the loci scored from plasma (ES<SUB>3</SUB>, ES<SUB>5</SUB>, PT<SUB>A</SUB>) in the computations of 
genetic distance between populations, the gene frequencies at <U>Pto. Real</U> for <I>M. musculus</I> were assumed to be the same as at <U>Barcelona</U>.

<P>Skins and skeletons of the wild animals collected for this study have been deposited in the collection of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Unground 
tissues and extracts, representing all of the alleles that were found, will be deposited as voucher specimens in the frozen tissue collection at the 
same institution.

<P><CENTER>RESULTS</CENTER>

<P>Twenty-three identified and three unidentified enzyme systems and seven non-enzymatic proteins, controlling a presumptive total of 56 structural gene loci, were surveyed (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt422 = window.open('../tables/table42-2.shtml', 'windowt422', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt422.focus()">Table 2</A>). 
The enzyme nomenclature used in this table follows as closely as possible that of Harris and Hopkinson (
<A HREF="#ref42-12">12</A>). Gene frequencies for variable loci are presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowt423 = window.open('../tables/table42-3.shtml', 'windowt423', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt423.focus()">Table 3</A>.

<P><CENTER>Description of Selected Loci and Alleles</CENTER>

<P><U>Lactate Dehydrogenases</U>. The sperm type enzyme (LDH<SUB>C</SUB>) runs cathodal to the other two lactate dehydrogenases. Variants observed at 
LDH<SUB>C</SUB> in <I>M. hispanicus</I> are the first reported for the genus. The heterozygote at this locus shows the typical five-banded pattern 
characteristic of a tetrameric molecule. The tetramers at this locus do not appear to interact and form heterotetramers with the other lactate dehydrogenase isozymes.

<P><U>Glyceraldehyde-Phosphate Dehydrogenases</U>. The presence of mercaptoethanol and NAD is necessary in the gel to produce isozymes with good banding 
qualities. No variants were seen in the locus running anodally (GAPDH<SUB>1</SUB>) in this study or in other work in progress on mice from Pacific islands. 
In scoring the second, cathodal locus a problem similar to that observed with the ADH isozymes is encountered, <I>i.e.</I>, there is interference in the 
staining of the more anodal allele (
<I>Gadph<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>.60</SUP></I>) due to the reactions of SOD<SUB>B</SUB>, and this slower allele is partially obscured. Variants at this locus, 
showing a typical dimeric structure, have been seen in Pacific island mice.

<A NAME="diaphorase"></A>
<P><U>NADH Diaphorases</U>. Studies of diaphorases in mice have not been reported so it is necessary to describe here the results of a survey of 
tissue and substrate specificities that were done in conjunction with this study. The diaphorase patterns seen in humans have been described (
<A HREF="#ref42-14">14</A>). The best resolution and greatest mobility of the slower isozymes was seen with the Tris-EDTA-borate buffer system (Buffer 4 of 
<a href="javascript:windowt421 = window.open('../tables/table42-1.shtml', 'windowt421', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt421.focus()">Table 1</A>). 
Extracts of the four tissue preparations, the two blood components, and the mitochondria were run on the same gel. The 
resultant banding patterns showed a heterogeneity of isozymes among the various tissue types. A minimum of five loci are thought to be controlling 
these isozymes based on their occurrences in different tissues, their differential response to the substrates NADH and NADPH, and the variation 
observed in the shapes of the bands. The most anodal system, designated as DIA<SUB>1</SUB>, was seen only in the testes-epididymides extract. This 
isozyme migrated well in front of the hemoglobin (<I>i.e.</I>, approximately 7 cm from the origin), and appeared as a thin band. The second fastest 
isozyme, designated as DIA<SUB>2</SUB>, showed the strongest staining activity in heart-kidney extract, but was also present at low levels in 
hemolysate and testes preparations. This isozyme appeared just cathodally to the SOD<SUB>A</SUB> achromatic region. It also stained strongly 
with NADPH as a substrate, which the other isozymes did no do. It formed a broad diffuse band in the <I>M. musculus</I> and a more narrow, slower 
band in the <I>M. hispanicus</I>. It was not studied any further because of this poor banding quality. The next-fastest isozyme, designated as 
DIA<SUB>3</SUB>, ran just cathodal to DIA<SUB>2</SUB>. It occurred in the heart-kidney, liver, hemolysate, and mitochondrial extracts. Because 
of interference from the strongly staining DIA<SUB>2</SUB> in some tissues, it was possible to score this isozyme only in hemolysate samples. This 
isozyme was the only one appearing in the mitochondrial preparation. The next locus, designated as DIA<SUB>4</SUB>, migrated about 10 mm cathodal 
to DIA<SUB>3</SUB>. It occurred in all samples but the plasma and mitochondria. This locus was surveyed in the testis preparations where there was 
considerable variation in staining intensity between individuals. Whether this variation represents a physiological or genetic source of variation is 
unknown. Only one mobility class was observed in the two species. The slowest isozyme migrated about 10 mm anodally from the origin. It was designated as 
DIA<SUB>5</SUB> and was observed only in the hemolysate sample. There was variation in banding patterns among the individuals, and this was attributed 
to genetic causes. Presumptive heterozygotes showed a two-banded phenotype suggesting a monomeric subunit structure.

<P>The above results are in partial agreement with the findings on human diaphorases (
<A HREF="#ref42-14">14</A>) where it is reported that both "sperm" and "red cell" isozymes are encoded by separate loci. These may be homologous to the 
DIA<SUB>1</SUB> and DIA<SUB>5</SUB> loci described here. They (
<A HREF="#ref42-14">14</A>) considered that their "tissue" isozyme was produced by the same "red cell" diaphorase locus. The fact that in this study there 
were no concordant changes in mobilities of the DIA<SUB>3</SUB> or DIA<SUB>4</SUB> isozymes in animals which were variable at the DIA<SUB>5</SUB> 
locus suggests that these former two isozymes are not coded for by the same erythrocytic locus. The higher activity of the DIA<SUB>3</SUB> isozyme in 
the mitochondrial preparation is suggestive of an independent locus that codes for an enzyme with a specific subcellular location. The broader 
substrate specificity of the DIA<SUB>2</SUB> isozyme (not studied here) provides support for considering this to be the product of still another locus.

<P><U>Nucleoside Phosphorylase</U>. The nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme migrated about 55 mm anodally. The heterozygotes showed a four-banded pattern, 
characteristic of a trimeric structure. In the regular extracts the allozymes are difficult to see because of a great amount of diffuse staining in the 
general region of the active molecules. The bands can be seen separately by diluting the extracts to about one-fifth of the normal concentration. A short 
distance anodally from the origin a second staining region was visible. Staining activity was found to be dependent on the presence of NADP, either in 
the gel itself or mixed into the staining mixture. Without all of the ingredients called for in the staining recipe plus the NADP the bands did not appear. 
This system was considered a separate unidentified enzyme (Enzyme-1). It was invariant within and between species.

<P><U>Phosphoglucomutase</U>. The pattern of isozymes observed when staining for phosphoglucomutases in kidney extracts was complex. A series of 
bands were seen, not all of which are phosphoglucomutases. Some of the bands represented isozymes controlled by other known enzyme loci, and one 
system was seen whose enzymological identity was not determined (Enzyme-2). Near the origin two systems are visible and these were subsequently found 
to be equivalent to the aconitase loci. More anodally the strongly staining PGM<SUB>2</SUB> enzyme is present, with a series of one or two weaker 
subbands extending still more anodally. In the most anodal region of staining activity two principal bands are observed in the C57BL sample. These 
correspond to the isozymes referred to as 1A<SUP>3</SUP> and 1A<SUP>4</SUP> in Figure 2(9) of Shows, Ruddle and Roderick (
<A HREF="#ref42-15">15</A>). In this study and in work done on Pacific island mice, mobility changes of these two bands were observed to occur independently. 
When the coupling enzyme G-6PDH is left out of the staining mixture the isozyme 1A<SUP>3</SUP> disappears, along with the PGM<SUB>2</SUB> bands, leaving 
only the 1A<SUP>4</SUP> band on the upper part of the gel. Accordingly, it is deduced that the 1A<SUP>3</SUP> component is the PGM<SUB>1</SUB> isozyme. 
The other band is called Enzyme-2 in this work. By using these differential staining characteristics, it was shown that the slower allele, 
<I>Pgm<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>.83</SUP></I>, migrates to a less anodal position than either of the two allelomorphs of Enzyme-2. In such cases the relative 
position of the isozymes of the two loci are reversed. Mobility variation at the unidentified locus (Enzyme-2) is considered to be due to genetic causes. 
Presumptive heterozygotes showed a two-banded phenotype.

<P><U>Esterases</U>. Esterases were scored only in the plasma and hemolysate samples. Because of the comparatively small number of samples of these 
types of extracts the survey of esterase variation must be considered preliminary. The assumption of genetic homology of the "null" allele pattern a the 
ES<SUB>2</SUB> and ES<SUB>5</SUB> loci in the two species is only presumptive, since the absence of staining might be due to a number of different reasons.

<P><U>Acid Phosphatases</U>. The two acid phosphatases that were scored show very different substrate affinities. The ACP<SUB>E</SUB> enzyme is seen 
as a fluorescent band when 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate is used as a substrate. The ACP<SUB>1</SUB> locus does not fluoresce, but is seen by staining 
with &alpha;-naphthyl phosphate as substrate. Gels used for assaying these loci contained 15% glycerol by volume which acts to enhance the relative staining 
activity of acid phosphatases (G. Sensebaugh, personal communication).

<P><U>Peptidases</U>. Isozymes of four peptidase loci were seen in liver samples. Based on the studies of substrate affinities, Lewis and Truslove (
<A HREF="#ref42-16">16</A>) identified three of the isozymes with homologous systems in humans. The slowest migrating isozyme seen in liver extracts is not 
present in hemolysates, and was not studied by these authors. It seems likely that this fourth isozyme is equivalent to the enzyme called PEPS (
<A HREF="#ref42-12">12</A>). In humans and mice this isozyme is present in liver but not in red cells, shows the least electrophoretic mobility, and reacts with 
both leucyl-alanine and leucyl-glycyl-glycine as substrates. Because of these similarities, they are assumed to be homologous. Mobility differences were 
observed at this locus in a few individuals and this was attributed to genetic variation. One animal showed a single faster migrating band. Other animals 
showed a two-banded phenotype, with the faster migrating band being somewhat weaker in staining intensity than the slower band. This asymmetry of staining 
might indicate a simple post-translational alteration of the enzyme molecule in the homozygous condition, except for the presence in one individual of 
the faster migrating, single-banded phenotype. This phenotype is not expected from such a non-genetical change in molecular structure.

<P><U>Aconitases</U>. Variation of these enzymes does not appear to have been studied in wild mice. The samples were in scored using muscle extracts, but 
the enzymes also stain well in heart-kidney and liver samples. One problem encountered during the staining reaction is the initial coloring, presumably 
caused by ICD<SUB>M</SUB>, near the origin of the cathodal slice of the gel. If the gel is left to stain, the ACON<SUB>M</SUB> bands begin to show through 
and can be scored without any further difficulty. Variation due to a genetic polymorphism was present at the ACON<SUB>S</SUB> locus. Heterozygotes showed 
a two-banded phenotype.

<P><U>Enolases</U>. These enzymes also appear not to have been studied in samples of wild mice. The presence of two loci controlling the observed banding 
patterns is inferred from variation in staining intensities of two isozymes in different tissue types. In extracts of muscle the faster band stained about 
three times as intensely as the slower band, but in liver extracts the staining intensity of the bands was reversed. In the heart-kidney samples the 
staining intensity was about equal for both bands. There was no staining observed in plasma, hemolysate, or mitochondrial extracts.

<P><U>Mannose Phosphate Isomerase</U>. Only one heterozygous animal was found in this study, although in the Pacific island <I>M. musculus</I> the level 
of polymorphism at this locus is much higher. In addition to the MPI isozyme found about 35 mm anodally, a second anodal isozyme was present about 3 mm 
from the origin. This band stained as intensely as the MPI isozyme, and is believed to represent the product of some unidentified enzyme locus (Enzyme-3). 
It was invariant and had the same mobility in both species.

<P><U>Non-enzymatic Proteins</U>. Seven proteins were assayed on gels stained with amido-black. In muscle extracts four proteins were studied: albumin, 
myoglobin, and two slower migrating proteins. Albumin is the most anodal, strongly staining protein in these extracts. The next principal band is identified 
as myoglobin, based on a positive staining response to a benzidine solution, which indicates the presence of a molecule containing a heme-group. This 
protein forms a comparatively broad band, and it migrates a couple of millimeters slower than hemoglobin on the lithium buffer system. The next fastest 
muscle protein band is a very thin one that migrates just cathodal to the PT<SUB>A</SUB> band found in plasma. This muscle protein is designated 
PT<SUB>1</SUB>. One putative variant animal showed a two-banded phenotype. The last protein scored from muscle extracts appears as a thin band migrating 
just cathodal to the previously described protein. It is designated PT<SUB>2</SUB>. There were fixed mobility differences between the two species at this 
locus. The behavior of this protein was variable between gels. On some gels there was a sharp band present, but on another gel it would appear as a diffuse 
staining region. In such cases runs were repeated until clearly resolved bands were produced.

<P><CENTER>Population Variability</CENTER>

<P>Of 56 loci studied, 27 (48%) were invariant, showing the same allelomorph in both species. Nineteen additional loci (35%) shared allelomorphs that were 
polymorphic in at least one sample, and ten loci (18%) showed total allelic dissimilarities between the species. The mean heterozygosity per locus (H) for 
each sample is given in 
<a href="javascript:windowt424 = window.open('../tables/table42-4.shtml', 'windowt424', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt424.focus()">Table 4</A>. 
These results show that the two species differ considerably in the average individual heterozygosity. The <I>M. musculus</I> 
animals are heterozygous at about twice (6-10%) the number of loci as <I>M. hispanicus</I> individuals (3.5-4.5%). Among the <I>M. musculus</I> populations 
the English mice have a slightly lower level of variability than animals from Spain.

<P>These measures of variability for <I>M. musculus</I> fall within the ranges reported for English and Danish populations (
<A HREF="#ref42-18">18</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref42-19">19</A>) of the subspecies <I>M. m. domesticus</I>. Twenty-one of the 22 loci studied (
<A HREF="#ref42-18">18</A>) in large samples of English mice were included in the present survey. At none of these loci were alleles found in the Abingdon sample 
that do not appear equivalent to variants described in that work.

<A NAME="relationship"></A>
<P><CENTER>Genetic Relationships</CENTER>

<A NAME="hbb"></A>
<P>The genetic relationships among the populations was determined using the distance measure (D) of Nei (
<A HREF="#ref42-20">20</A>), which is defined as the average number of codon differences per locus. Because hemolysate samples were not collected from some localities, 
no gene frequency estimates were available for four loci (<I>i.e.</I>, DIA<SUB>3</SUB>, DIA<SUB>5</SUB>, ES<SUB>3</SUB>, HBB) for all populations. The 
estimates of gene frequency used in the calculations came from data for the remaining 52 loci. The results of the computations are presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowt425 = window.open('../tables/table42-5.shtml', 'windowt425', 'width=1000,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt425.focus()">Table 5</A>. 
The D-value matrix was clustered with a complete linkage technique (
<A HREF="#ref42-21">21</A>) and is depicted in 
<a href="javascript:windowf422 = window.open('../figures/figure42-2.shtml', 'windowf422', 'width=800,height=350,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf422.focus()">Figure 2</A>. 
These results show three interesting features: the very marked genetic difference between <I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. hispanicus</I>; 
the great similarity among <I>M. musculus</I> populations, even when separated by great distances and topographic barriers; and the distinctiveness of the 
inbred laboratory mouse from its putative ancestor.

<P>The occurrence of numerous fixed allelic differences between wild and commensal populations of mice at <U>Balenya</U> and <U>Pto. Real</U> shows that 
these animals do not interbreed and represent distinct species. The genetic distance values (D = 0.3 - 0.4) between <I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. hispanicus</I> 
reflects the great amount of divergence between these lineages. Intraspecific, interpopulation values of genetic distance can be considered as controls for 
the expected random sampling variance due to the numbers of animals per sample, the number of loci studied, or to founding events (see below). In this study 
these values range from 0.01 to 0.04 and are about one order of magnitude smaller than the interspecific genetic distances. The interspecific distances 
observed between these mice are similar to those reported for other rodents [(
<A HREF="#ref42-20">20</A>); M. Smith and J.L Patton, personal communication].

<A NAME="domesticus"></A>
<P>The interpopulation distance values among the <I>M. musculus</I> samples are small and comparable to the values observed in a wide array of animal taxa (
<A HREF="#ref42-22">22</A>). Similar levels of interpopulational genetic distance within, but not between, two subspecific lineages of Danish house mice have been reported (
<A HREF="#ref42-19">19</A>). Genetic distances of this order of D (approximately 0.05) were observed between samples of <I>M. m. domesticus</I> from different farms within 
a five-kilometer radius in England (
<A HREF="#ref42-18">18</A>) and it was suggested that such differences were to be expected from stochastic processes altering gene frequencies during the founding of 
local populations. Similar small distance values were observed between the English <I>M. musculus</I> and populations from Spain, in spite of the great geographical 
distance separating this population from the others and the water barrier separating the English and continental land masses. This similarity in proteins between 
nominally different subspecies of house mice (<I>M. m. domesticus</I> and <I>M. m. brevirostris</I>) in western Europe contrasts greatly with the observed situation 
in northern and eastern Europe, where <I>M. m. domesticus</I> and <I>M. m. musculus</I> are found (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf421 = window.open('../figures/figure42-1.shtml', 'windowf421', 'width=650,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf421.focus()">Figure 1</A>). 
In Demark, where genetic studies comparable to those reported here were done (
<A HREF="#ref42-19">19</A>), populations of the two subspecies had genetic distances computed to be D = 0.19. The contrast in magnitude of genetic divergence indicates 
the considerable heterogeneity contained within the currently recognized subspecific taxa of <I>M. musculus</I> in Europe, and shows how misleading this form of 
nomenclature can be in denoting genetic relationships among populations.

<P>Selander and Yang (
<A HREF="#ref42-23">23</A>), working on house mice in the United States, were unable to detect major gene frequency differences between northern and southern populations 
which have been classified as belonging to <I>M. m. domesticus</I> and <I>M. m. brevirostris</I>, respectively (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>). Their results are in agreement with the findings of the present study of native populations of mice from which the United States animals 
may well have originated, in that no major allelic differences appear to distinguish these taxa.

<P>The last point of interest emerging from this work is the relatively great genetic distance of the inbred mouse from what might be considered its native 
progenitor. The C57BL mice show consistently greater distance from the wild populations of England and Spain (D = 0.10 - 0.13) than do any of the latter among 
themselves. While the homozygosity of an inbred mouse would be expected to introduce a distance component in any comparison with a genetically variable population, 
because of the impossibility of expressing any of the original variability that the lineage may have contained, a good part of the distance value of the C57BL 
mice is due to the presence of two "private" alleles (<I>Es<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>1.00</SUP></I> and <I>Pep<SUB>C</SUB><SUP>1.00</SUP></I>) that were not observed in 
any of the native European mice.

<A NAME="molossinus"></A>
<P>The C57BL lineage of the inbred strains is genetically quite distinct from the bulk of inbred mice (
<A HREF="#ref42-24">24</A>). It is likely that they owe part of their distinctiveness to a contribution from the oriental subspecies of house mouse (<I>M. m. molossinus</I>), 
via the Japanese fancy mice available in the pet trade in the early part of this century (
<A HREF="#ref42-25">25</A>). Determination of the genes segregating in samples of free-living mice in Japan and Korea would provide an answer to this question. It is 
apparent, however, that most of the genes in this inbred strain could have been derived from native populations of western European mice.

<P><CENTER>DISCUSSION</CENTER>

<A NAME="Robertsonian"></A><A NAME="caroli"></A><A NAME="homourus"></A><A NAME="poschiavinus"></A>
<P>This study was initiated because according to the modern paradigm of the biological species concept the presence of coexisting subspecies is contrary to predictions. 
The results indeed show that the Spanish mice are divided into two genetically isolated gene pools and must be considered as separate species taxa. Other recent 
studies of native house mice have revealed distinctive species concealed under the classificatory scheme of Schwarz and Schwarz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>). Marshall (
<A HREF="#ref42-26">26</A>) showed that the species <I>Mus caroli</I> in eastern Asia was not a synonym of <I>M. m. homourus</I>. Gropp <I>et al.</I> (
<A HREF="#ref42-27">27</A>) showed that <I>M. poschiavinus</I>, which had been subsumed into <I>M. m. domesticus</I>, was a valid species and was characterized by seven 
Robertsonian fusions between acrocentric chromosomes. In addition to the above demonstrated cases of reproductively isolated species populations within the range 
of the house mouse, Schwartz and Schwartz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>) report the coexistence of other subspecies of mice in central and eastern Asia. There is every reason to expect that these also represent valid 
species taxa. All of this indicates that the present scheme (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>) for the classification of the house mouse is invalid and that a revised systematic treatment is needed.

<P>With the decline and fall of old taxonomic arrangements, those interested in the native house mice are left with a blank slate on which to reconstruct the 
evolutionary history of these animals. However a new paradigm develops, it will differ radically from the earlier one (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>) in which much of the differentiation of the group was attributed to the coevolution of mice with man and his agriculture. The time scale for 
the divergence among some lineages (<I>e.g.</I>, <I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. hispanicus</I>) will have to be framed in Plio-Pleistocene times, based on the 
size of the genetic distance values reported in this paper. Even the assumption of specific morphological changes as being associated with the development 
of the commensal habit with man may be incorrect. Tchernov (
<A HREF="#ref42-28">28</A>) reported that the mandible shape of <I>M. musculus</I> fossils in deposits in Israel remained identical to recent materials (commensal forms), 
throughout the Pleistocene. Thus the skull morphology typical of commensal mice antedates agricultural practices in the region and suggests that the phenotype 
was determined by selective forces independently of the commensal behavior pattern.

<P>The new systematics of the house mice will differ from the earlier attempt in that both the external phenotype as well as the genotype will be examined. 
With the development of more powerful analytical methods for studying changes in the genome, an increasing interest in native house mice as a source of 
additional genetic material for laboratory studies, and an awareness that multidisciplinary approaches will yield a more satisfactory interpretation of 
such a historical process, the house mouse will continue to make valuable contributions to our understanding of organic evolution.


<P><CENTER>SUMMARY</CENTER>

<P>On the Iberian peninsula sympatric populations of two subspecies of house mice (<I>M. musculus</I>) were reported by Schwarz and Schwarz (
<A HREF="#ref42-1">1</A>). The genetic structure of these mouse populations from localities in Spain was studied using electrophoretic techniques. Wild mice from England 
and an inbred laboratory strain (C57BL) were also studied as outside reference points. Enzyme and other proteins, presumptively controlled by 56 structural gene loci, 
were identified in animals of both subspecific phenotypic classes. The results show that these two kinds of Spanish mice differ at many loci and there is no sign of 
intermediate genotypes. The two populations must be considered as full species: <I>M. m. brevirostris</I> and <I>M. hispanicus</I>. Average heterozygosity in 
<I>M. m. brevirostris</I> was twice as great as in <I>M. hispanicus</I>. There were no other major allelic differences between English and Spanish populations of 
<I>M. musculus</I>, although they are currently recognized as different subspecies. The inbred mouse was genetically distinct from wild populations of its putative 
ancestors. The difference is thought to result from genes introduced into the lineage from oriental populations of <I>M. musculus</I>. The adequacy of the current 
paradigm of house mouse classification is discussed.

<P><CENTER>ADDENDUM</CENTER>

<P>After this manuscript was completed, a paper describing biochemical differences between "long-tailed" (commensal) and "short-tailed" (aboriginal) 
mice in southern France was discovered (
<A HREF="#ref42-36">36</A>). These forms are the same as the <I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. hispanicus</I> populations described in the present work. 
Professor Thaler (personal communication) suggests that Cabrera (
<A HREF="#ref42-9">9</A>) was incorrect in considering the Algerian <I>M. spretus</I> a different species from the wild animals he found in Morocco 
and Spain (here considered as <I>M. hispanicus</I>). If future field work in the region of the type locality in Algeria shows that there is 
only one type of wild mouse in this whole area then, because of nomenclatorial considerations, the proper name for the populations in Spain 
will be <I>M. spretus</I>.
