<P>The discipline of tumor immunology, like so many other biological fields of contemporary importance, owes its origin to the innovators 
whom we honor at this workshop. Without their development and characterization of inbred strains, it would be difficult to imagine how the 
principles that underlie modern immunological approaches to cancer could have been established. The demonstration of tumor-specific antigens 
in chemical and virus-induced tumors, the development of methods to analyze cellular and humoral immunity to tumors, and the finding that 
tumor immunity could be bolstered by microbial agents, such as BCG, represent the legacy from work with the inbred mouse that has engendered 
the vast interest in applying similar approaches to human cancer.

<P>To the cancer immunologist, cell surface antigens are of paramount importance, for it is novel antigens incorporated into the tumor cell 
surface that can serve as transplantation antigens and provoke immunological rejection. Although such transplantation techniques provided 
the first evidence for tumor-specific surface antigens, serological techniques have far more potential for analyzing the surface composition 
of tumor cells. With advances in methods to determine cellular immune reactions <I>in vitro</I>, these can be expected to take their place 
with serological techniques in the analysis of cell surface antigens of tumors. Present knowledge about these antigens, however, has come 
almost exclusively from the application of serological techniques, and of these, the cytotoxic test has proved most successful in the 
identification and analysis of surface antigens, some of which would have been impossible to discover by techniques involving graft rejection.

<P>The cytotoxic test, originally developed by Gorer and O'Gorman to detect antibody to H-2 products, is a simple technique in which cells 
are lysed by antibody in the presence of a suitable source of complement (
<A HREF="#ref25-1">1</A>). The test has evolved through a series of modifications and, in its present form, is an analytical method of unrivaled 
specificity and sensitivity for the detection of cell surface antigens. Because leukemia cells can be easily obtained in free cell suspension 
and are exquisitely sensitive to cytotoxic antibody, they have been a favorite object of study. The great majority of mouse leukemias are T 
cells of thymic origin, and this has allowed the serologist to study the leukemia cell side by side with its normal counterpart, the thymocyte. 
As a consequence of these advantages, more is known about the surface antigens of normal an malignant T cells than about any other cell 
population of the mouse (
<A HREF="#ref25-2">2</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-3">3</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-4">4</A>).

<P>Four general classes of cell surface antigens have been distinguished on mouse leukemias: 1) conventional H-2 alloantigens, that are present 
on virtually all cells of the adult mouse; 2) differentiation alloantigens, <I>e.g.</I>, Thy-1 and the Lyt series, and several products of the 
<I>H-2-Ir</I> and <I>Q</I> complex whose presence signify selective gene activation in cells undergoing T cell differentiation; 3) MuLV-related 
antigens, <I>e.g.</I>, GCSA, G<SUB>IX</SUB>, G<SUB>(RADA1)</SUB>, that owe their origin to genetic information of endogenous murine leukemia 
viruses; and 4) TL (thymus-leukemia) antigens that occur as differentiation alloantigens restricted to normal thymocytes in TL<SUP>+</SUP> 
strains of mice and as leukemia-specific antigens in mouse strains not normally expressing TL antigens (TL<SUP>-</SUP> strains).

<A NAME="FMR"></A>
<P>Before discussing the MuLV and TL systems in more detail, some mention should be made of the immunization procedures that were devised to 
produce antibody to these cell surface antigens (
<a href="javascript:windowt251 = window.open('../tables/table25-1.shtml', 'windowt251', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt251.focus()">Table 1</A>). 
To define non-H-2 specificities, the challenge was to develop methods of immunization or testing that would eliminate 
the contribution of H-2 antibodies. This has been accomplished in three principal ways. The first can be illustrated by the approach that led 
to the detection of TL and GCSA antigens and involves immunization with H-2 incompatible leukemia cells and testing the resulting antiserum on 
syngeneic leukemia cells (
<A HREF="#ref25-5">5</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-6">6</A>). The rationale behind this immunization was that the allogeneic and syngeneic leukemia cells share a common antigen. In the 
case of TL, C57BL mice were immunized with A strain spontaneous leukemia and the antiserum was tested on a C57BL x-ray-induced leukemia, thus 
eliminating reactions due to H-2 and other alloantibodies. The second method involves donor-recipient combinations that are H-2 compatible and 
this was first used to produce antibody to &theta;, or as it is now known, the Thy-1 antigen (
<A HREF="#ref25-7">7</A>). Syngeneic immunization, although theoretically the method of choice to produce antibody with leukemia specificity, has 
failed to uncover leukemia-specific antigens in spontaneous, x-ray or chemically induced mouse leukemias. Two antigenic systems, however, 
were defined with antisera raised by syngeneic immunization; the FMR complex of antigens associated with leukemias induced by Friend, Moloney, 
and Rausher leukemia viruses (
<A HREF="#ref25-8">8</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-9">9</A>) and the MuLV-related G<SUB>IX</SUB> antigen, originally identified with sera produced in W/Fu rats immunized with syngeneic 
MuLV-induced leukemia cells (
<A HREF="#ref25-10">10</A>). The ease with which antibody can be raised to these antigens is undoubtedly related to the strong immunogenicity of 
FMR mouse leukemias and MuLV-induced rat leukemias in syngeneic hosts. These leukemias can undergo regression after initial growth, in 
contrast to the invariable growth of transplants of spontaneous leukemias or leukemias induced by physical or chemical agents in their 
strain of origin.

<A NAME="surface"></A>
<P>In addition to antisera prepared by deliberate immunization, naturally occurring antibodies in normal mouse serum are becoming increasingly 
valuable as reagents to define the spectrum of cell surface antigens specified by murine leukemia viruses (
<a href="javascript:windowt252 = window.open('../tables/table25-2.shtml', 'windowt252', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt252.focus()">Table 2</A>). 
With the exception of antibody to GCSA, which has not yet been found in the serum of normal mice, antibody to the other 
MuLV-related specificities is found with characteristic frequency in different mouse strains. Thus far, F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids have been the best 
source of these antibodies, and this most probably has to do with heterozygosity at <I>Ir</I> loci which broadens the range of antigens 
that can be recognized.

<A NAME="Gantigen"></A>
<P>The list of MuLV-related specificities recognized by mouse antibody is rapidly growing and is coming to parallel the remarkable diversity of 
MuLV recognizable by virological and biochemical methods. The use of the letter G to designate cell surface antigens related to naturally occurring 
MuLV was intended to honor Ludwig Gross, the discoverer of this class of oncornaviruses. Until a more definite nomenclature can be devised for 
these antigens, it has been proposed that new MuLV-related cell surface specificities of the G class be named after the prototype normal or 
leukemic cell used in defining the antigen, and this has been done in the case of G<SUB>(RADA1)</SUB>, G<SUB>(ERLD)</SUB>, and G<SUB>(AKSL2)</SUB>. 
Because the GCSA and G<SUB>IX</SUB> designations are widely used, it would seem unwise to rename them according to this new convention at the 
present time.

<P>Each of the five MuLV-related surface antigens can be distinguished on the basis of their strain distribution, tissue distribution, and appearance 
in leukemias and other tumors of strains that normally do not express these antigens. Their specification by MuLV is shown in two general ways: 
<U>relation to MuLV structural components</U>, either by absorption studies with purified MuLV proteins or by immunochemical characterization of the 
cell surface molecule, and <U>antigen induction following MuLV infection of permissive cells</U>. In this way, GCSA has been shown to be a glycosylated 
polyprotein related to p15 and p30 viral core proteins, and G<SUB>IX</SUB>, G<SUB>(RADA1)</SUB> and G<SUB>(ERLD)</SUB> have been shown to be 
type-specific determinants of gp70 molecules. In assays of antigen induction by MuLV, GCSA appears to be a general marker for MuLV infection, with 
GCSA expression being induced by ecotropic, xenotropic, and amphotropic MuLV. In the case of the gp70-related antigens, G<SUB>IX</SUB> and G<SUB>(RADA1)</SUB> 
induction is a common property of ecotropic MuLV, particularly those with N-tropism, and G<SUB>(ERLD)</SUB> is closely related to xenotropic MuLV in 
induction assays. The most recently defined MuLV-related specificity, G<SUB>(AKLS2)</SUB>, is closely related to xenotropic MuLV in induction assays. 
The most recently defined MuLV-related specificity, G<SUB>(AKLS2)</SUB>, is related to the dualtropic MuLV, MCF 247, a virus thought to arise by 
recombination between ecotropic and xenotropic MuLV (
<A HREF="#ref25-19">19</A>), and recognition of the G<SUB>(AKLS2)</SUB> system provides a way to examine the natural history of this virus in the mouse.

<A NAME="Gv-1"></A>
<P>Of the various MuLV-related cell surface specificities, the G<SUB>IX</SUB> trait has been the subject of the most comprehensive immunogenetic analysis (
<a href="javascript:windowt253 = window.open('../tables/table25-3.shtml', 'windowt253', 'width=600,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt253.focus()">Table 3</A>). 
In normal mice, G<SUB>IX</SUB> behaves like an alloantigen, being present in some mouse strains and not in others. It 
also has the characteristics of a differentiation antigen, being present in some tissues and absent in others, and this feature is most evident in 
strains such as 129, where thymocytes are the only G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> lymphoid cells. Thymocytes from different G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> 
strains show characteristic quantitative differences in G<SUB>IX</SUB> expression and, as absorption capacity follows a ratio of 3:2:1, the three 
phenotypes have been termed G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>, G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>, and G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>1</SUP>. Segregation data are consistent 
with a two-gene specification of the G<SUB>IX</SUB> trait, and these two genes have been designated 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95877" target="_blank"><I>Gv-1</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95878" target="_blank"><I>Gv-2</I></A>. 
Despite considerable 
effort, the chromosomal loci of these genes remain unknown (
<A HREF="#ref25-4">4</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-20">20</A>). The relation of G<SUB>IX</SUB> to MuLV has been shown in a variety of ways: 1) <I>in vivo</I> infection of G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> 
mouse and rat strains with MuLV leads to G<SUB>IX</SUB> appearance, 2) <I>in vitro</I> infection of permissive cells with certain ecotropic and 
MCF MuLV leads to G<SUB>IX</SUB> appearance, and 3) the G<SUB>IX</SUB> determinant on the surface of thymocytes and MuLV-infected cells resides 
on a molecule with antigenic and biochemical characteristics of MuLV-gp70. Peptide maps of the G<SUB>IX</SUB>-gp70 on normal thymocytes suggest 
a relationship to xenotropic MuLV (
<A HREF="#ref25-21">21</A>), even though MuLV-induction assays have shown a close association of the G<SUB>IX</SUB> trait with ecotropic MuLV (
<A HREF="#ref25-12">12</A>). This would suggest that thymocyte G<SUB>IX</SUB> represents the product of an ancestral gene coding for a recombinant gp70 
molecule that has become fixed in the species, with the G<SUB>IX</SUB> determinant originally contributed by ecotropic MuLV and the remainder 
of the gp70 molecule by xenotropic MuLV. The fact that the MCF 247 MuLV, a virus with both ecotropic and xenotropic properties, codes for G<SUB>IX</SUB> 
is consistent with this idea.

<A NAME="TL"></A>
<P>From studies of leukemic mice, we know that all mice have the genetic information specifying G<SUB>IX</SUB>, even though they may not express 
G<SUB>IX</SUB> during normal life as a consequence of differentiation signals or MuLV activation. The basis for this statement is the observation 
that G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> leukemias occur in G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> strains of mice as well as in G<SUB>IX</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> strains, 
and this may occur in the absence of MuLV replication. This activation of normally silent genetic information as a consequence of leukemogenesis 
was first recognized during our analysis of another class of cell surface molecules, the TL system of antigens (
<A HREF="#ref25-5">5</A>). TL antigens and the G<SUB>IX</SUB> antigen have many features in common, with the notable exception that there is presently no 
evidence linking MuLV to the TL system.

<A NAME="Tla"></A>
<P>In normal mice, TL is found exclusively on thymocytes, no other normal tissue expressing the antigen (
<a href="javascript:windowt254 = window.open('../tables/table25-4.shtml', 'windowt254', 'width=600,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt254.focus()">Table 4</A>). 
Mouse strains can be typed TL<SUP>+</SUP> or TL<SUP>-</SUP> on the basis of the presence or absence of TL antigen on 
thymocytes and, like G<SUB>IX</SUB>, antigen-negative mice have no alternative antigens specified by an alternate allele. TL is inherited as a 
Mendelian dominant trait, and linkage studies have placed the TL locus, designated 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A>, 
on chromosome 17 &#060; 2 units from the D end of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" target="_blank"><I>H-2</I></A> 
complex. The key feature of the TL system in regard to malignancy is the anomalous occurrence of TL<SUP>+</SUP> leukemias in 
strains with the TL<SUP>-</SUP> phenotype (
<a href="javascript:windowt255 = window.open('../tables/table25-5.shtml', 'windowt255', 'width=600,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt255.focus()">Table 5</A>). 
This can best be seen by comparing the TL phenotype of normal thymocytes and of leukemia cells in mice with different 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> haplotypes. The three 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95950" target="_blank"><I>Tla</I></A> haplotypes determine 
three TL phenotypes in normal mice. A strain mice with the <I>Tla<SUP>a</SUP></I> 
haplotype express three specificities of TL, TL.1, TL.2, and TL.3, on their normal thymocytes. C57BL/6 mice, the prototype strain with the 
<I>Tla<SUP>b</SUP></I> haplotype, express no TL antigens on normal thymocytes. BALB/c mice with the <I>Tla<SUP>c</SUP></I> haplotype express 
TL.2 alone on normal thymocytes. In mice with the <I>Tla<SUP>a</SUP></I> haplotype, TL<SUP>+</SUP> leukemias resemble normal thymocytes and 
no evidence for appearance of anomalous TL components has been found. Leukemias arising in mice with the <I>Tla<SUP>b</SUP></I> or 
<I>Tla<SUP>c</SUP></I> haplotype may be either TL<SUP>-</SUP> or TL<SUP>+</SUP>, and TL<SUP>+</SUP> leukemias invariably express anomalous 
TL components; TL.1, TL.2 and TL.4 in the case of C57BL leukemias and TL.1 or TL.1 and TL.4 in the case of BALB/c leukemias.

<P>The anomalous appearance of TL antigens has been attributed to the universal presence of structural genes for TL antigens in the mouse. 
According to this view, regulatory genes determine whether TL is expressed on normal thymocytes. Thus, segregation for the Tl trait in normal 
mice in based on expression vs. nonexpression alleles at the regulatory locus rather than presence vs. absence of TL structural genes. 
Leukemogenesis leads to an alteration in this regulatory mechanism in TL<SUP>-</SUP> mice, with consequent activation or derepression of TL 
genetic information and the appearance of TL antigens on the surface of leukemia cells. Antigen systems with the three distinct features of 
TL -- namely, genetic linkage to the major histocompatibility complex, restriction to normal thymocytes, and anomalous appearance on 
leukemias -- have not been found in any other species, but it would be surprising if the mouse were unique in this regard.

<P>With the range of surface markers that have been identified on T cells of the mouse, the surface phenotype of normal thymocytes and leukemias 
of thymic origin is becoming well characterized. A comparison of the surface antigens of three leukemias that have been extensively studied with 
the corresponding normal thymocyte population is shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowt256 = window.open('../tables/table25-6.shtml', 'windowt256', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt256.focus()">Table 6</A>.

<P>The thymic origin of the AKR spontaneous leukemia AKSL2 is shown by the Thy-1 marker, despite the fact that no Lyt antigens could be detected 
on this leukemia. As is true of most spontaneous leukemias of AKR mice, the leukemia cells express no anomalous TL components. The five MuLV-related 
specificities found on the leukemia cells are also present on normal thymocytes. Thus, with regard to TL and MuLV-related antigens, the surface 
phenotype of this AKR leukemia does not differ from normal thymocytes, at least in a qualitative sense.

<P>The A strain x-ray-induced leukemia RADA1 also lacks Lyt antigens, but its T cell origin is indicated by Thy-1 and by the three TL specificities 
(TL.1, 2, 3) that appear on RADA1 as differentiation alloantigens. The other surface feature that distinguishes RADA1 from normal A strain thymocytes 
is the anomalous appearance of the MuLV-related specificity G<SUB>(Rada1)</SUB> on the leukemia cell.

<P>The surface phenotype of the C57BL x-ray-induced leukemia ERLD illustrates the phenomenon of anomalous TL appearance. In contrast to the 
TL<SUP>-</SUP> phenotype of normal C57BL thymocytes, leukemia ERLD has a TL.1, 2, 4 phenotype. With regard to other surface antigens, ERLD and C57BL 
thymocytes are identical.

<A NAME="specific"></A>
<P>The recognition that cell surface antigens such as TL and G<SUB>(RADA1)</SUB> may be leukemia specific in some strains, yet be normally expressed 
as differentiation alloantigens or MuLV-related antigens in other strains, has been an important contribution of basic immunogenetics to tumor 
immunology. As yet, no transformation-specific surface antigen restricted to leukemia cells of the mouse has been found. TL.4 comes closest to 
fulfilling this characteristic, having never been found on any normal cell of any mouse strain. Recent work, however, has shown that anomalous 
TL components, including Tl.4, are expressed early in the preleukemic phase of x-ray leukemogenesis, prior to the emergence of fully autonomous 
cells, and should therefore be considered markers for preleukemic changes rather than as transformation-specific traits (
<A HREF="#ref25-22">22</A>).

<P>
<a href="javascript:windowt257 = window.open('../tables/table25-7.shtml', 'windowt257', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt257.focus()">Table 7</A> 
summarizes current knowledge about the categories of surface antigens of mouse leukemia cells (
<A HREF="#ref25-4">4</A>). The term "derepression antigens" has been used to distinguish antigens appearing on the surface of tumor cells that are coded 
for by normally silent genetic information. The TL and MuLV-related antigens appearing on leukemias of TL<SUP>-</SUP> and MuLV<SUP>-</SUP> strains 
would be prime examples of derepression antigens. Tumor antigens coded for by genes active only in embryonic or fetal life would also belong in this 
category, but, despite considerable interest in the possibility of such tumor antigens, their existence remains to be proven. Another category of 
cell surface antigens of particular interest to the tumor immunologist is the individually distinct or unique tumor-specific antigen, first 
demonstrated by transplantation techniques in chemically induced sarcomas of the mouse (
<A HREF="#ref25-23">23</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-24">24</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-25">25</A>) and now known to be present on several other tumor types of mouse and rat. These antigens are characterized by a remarkable 
polymorphism, no two tumors, even if induced in the same mouse, sharing identical antigens. The origin of these unique antigens has been the subject 
of considerable speculation, with both genetic and epigenetic theories having been advanced, but their nature remains as obscure now as it was when 
they were discovered. With the recognition that MuLV exists in a far more polymorphic state than originally envisioned, the possibility that these 
unique antigens owe their origin to MuLV genes must be reconsidered, especially since recombinational event between different classes of MuLV and 
between MuLV and host genes, which appears likely as a source of MuLV variation, would be expected to give rise to an enormous repertoire of new 
antigens. Further understanding awaits serological and biochemical definition of these antigens, and advances in both these directions have recently 
been made with a methylcholanthrene sarcoma of BALB/c mice (
<A HREF="#ref25-26">26</A>, 
<A HREF="#ref25-27">27</A>). As yet, little effort has gone into the serological detection of unique antigens on leukemia cells. Their presence could be 
easily obscured by cross-reacting systems such as Tl or MuLV-related antigens. With the background of information we now have concerning the surface 
phenotype of leukemia cells, planned immunizations devised to detect new systems of surface antigens, including the individually distinct type, should 
make the next phase of immunogenetic analysis a most revealing one.
