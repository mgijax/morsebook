<P>Three different strain combinations have produced alloantisera that agglutinate red cells from mouse strains C57BL/6J 
and C57BL/By, but do not react with cells from strains C57BL/10Sn, C57BL/10J, or C57BL/10Gn-Rn/+ (Rn/+ or +/+). Erythrocytes 
from 35 H-2 and non-H-2 congenic lines on the C57BL/Sn background are unreactive, whereas red cells from all other inbred 
strains tested to date, including related strains C57L/J, C57BR/cdJ, C57BL/KsJ, and C58/J are reactive. This pattern of 
serological reactivity is different from that of any known erythrocyte antigen system of the mouse and suggests residual 
heterozygosity or a mutation in an early progenitor of the C57BL/10 substrain family.

<P>We have recently developed a congenic line in which a histocompatibility (H) allele from strain C57BL/10Sn was introduced 
onto a C57BL/6J background by 16 successive generations of backcross followed by sib mating. Cells from mice selected at the 
first intercross generation for homozygosity at the introduced H allele were serotyped with one of the alloantisera 
characterized above. They were unreactive or phenotypically like cells from strain C57BL/10Sn. Thus it appears that the 
erythrocyte antigen described here is determined by a locus closely linked to, or perhaps identical with, a histocompatibility 
locus that distinguishes between strains C57BL/6J and C57BL/10Sn.
