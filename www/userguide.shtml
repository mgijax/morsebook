<H2>A User's Guide to <I>Origins of Inbred Mice</I></H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>The purpose of this User's Guide is to assist you in using all of the features of the electronic version of 
<I>Origins of Inbred Mice</I>.

<H3>Navigation</H3>

<P>There are several ways to navigate through this book:

<UL>
<LI>The Table of Contents</LI>
<LI>The Subject Index</LI>
<LI>The abbreviated Table of Contents in the left column of most pages</LI>
<LI>The <B>Previous</B> and <B>Next</B> links at the top and bottom of most pages</LI>
<LI>Internal links within the body of the text</LI>
</UL>

<P>The 
<A HREF="contents.shtml">Table of Contents</A> lists Chapter headings. Click on any link in the Table of Contents to go 
to that section of the text.

<P>The 
<A HREF="frames/framesubjectindex.shtml">Subject Index</A> list topics alphabetically. Click on any link to go to that Table, Figure, or section of the text.

<P>See 
<A HREF="frames/frame1.shtml">Chapter 1</A> for an example of the abbreviated Table of Contents and the Previous and Next links.

<H3>Special Features</H3>

<P><B>References:</B> Citations within the body of the text are linked to the appropriate reference 
in the <B>References</B> section. Many of the references are also in the body of literature curated 
by Mouse Genome Informatics. These will have a link to the citation in MGI below the citation in the 
<B>References</B> section. Clicking the link to MGI will take you to the references detail page at MGI. For example,  
<A HREF="frames/framekeeler.shtml">Keeler (1931)</A> is also curated at MGI. Clicking the link to MGI lets you search for 
Genes, Markers and Phenotypes, Marker Mapping Information, or Molecular Probes and Segments in MGI 
from this reference. This page also links to the citation in PubMed. Other references are not curated 
at MGI, but are curated in PubMed. For example, 
<A HREF="frames/framepotter.shtml">Potter and Lieberman (1967)</A> is such a citation. Clicking the link to 
PubMed take you to the page containing the Abstract and several useful search features: click 
<B>Related Articles</B> to see references that may be more up to date, or 
<B>Books</B> to see chapters from reference works related to the subject of the reference.

<P><B>Genes and Alleles:</B> All mouse genes mentioned in the text are linked to MGI pages containing 
information on those genes, including current nomenclature. The link may be to a Gene Detail page, 
such as that for the gene referred to in the text as the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98880" target="_blank">albino (c)</A> locus. 
The link may also be to an Allele Detail page, such as that for the  
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'--> MGI:1856305" target="_blank"><I>c<SUP>6H</SUP></I></A> allele.

<P><B>Tables:</B> Clicking a reference to a Table within the text will cause that Table to appear 
in a new browser window (see, for example, Table 
<A HREF="javascript:windowt111 = window.open('tables/table11-1.shtml', 'windowt111', 'width=800,height=1000,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt111.focus()">11-1</A>). 
All Tables are listed on the 
<A HREF="frames/frametables.shtml">Tables</A> page.

<P><B>Figures:</B> Clicking a reference to a Figure within the text will cause that Figure to 
appear in a new browser window (see, for example, Figure
<A HREF="javascript:windowf151 = window.open('figures/figure15-1.shtml', 'windowf151', 'width=650,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf151.focus()">15-1</A>). 
All Figures are listed on the 
<A HREF="frames/framefigures.shtml">Figures</A> page.

<P><B>Subject Index:</B> The  
<A HREF="frames/framesubjectindex.shtml">Subject Index</A> from the book has links to the relevant section of the text, 
or to tables and figures, in place of the page numbers found in the book as it was originally published.
