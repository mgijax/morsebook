<P>FIGURE 2. The number of fixed gene differences expected between hypothetical sublines relative to the generation 
at which they branched. Both sublines are considered to have been equally inbred for 154 (an arbitrarily chosen number) 
generations of full-sib mating. To correct for additional (or fewer) generations of inbreeding, add (or subtract) (0.3) 
times the sum of the generations that both sublines have been inbred beyond (or before) F154. Curve A shows the 
contribution from new mutations alone, while curve B shows the contribution of residual heterozygosity in addition 
to that of mutation. The example presented in the text is represented by dashed lines and numbers in parentheses.
