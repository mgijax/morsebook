<P>FIGURE 5. Isozymes of glucose phosphate isomerase found in embryos of various ages (
<A HREF="#ref17-10">10</A>). The mother is 
<I>Gpi-1<SUP>a</SUP>/Gpi-1<SUP>a</SUP></I>, the father is 
<I>Gpi-1<SUP>b</SUP>/Gpi-1<SUP>b</SUP></I>, the embryo 
<I>Gpi-1<SUP>a</SUP>/Gpi-1<SUP>b</SUP></I>. Phenotype GPI-1A is present in the mother, GPI-1B in the father. GPI-1AB is the pattern expected in a heterozygous adult. Blastocysts were removed from the mother on days 3, 4, 5, and 6 after fertilization and their isozymic patterns were examined by starch gel electrophoresis. GPI-1AB and GPI-1B which represent paternal gene products were first observed on day 5.
