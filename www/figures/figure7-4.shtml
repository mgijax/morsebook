<P>This sculpture of Ak mice crawling over bookends is a faewell gift 
from my colleagues at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. It was carved in 
cherry wood by a Cherokee whittler. It was presented to me with the statement 
(which touched me with surprise and jealousy) that the Ak mice may long survive me. How true!
