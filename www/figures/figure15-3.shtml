<P>FIGURE 3. An equivalence curve that allows comparison of the relative importance of mutation and residual 
heterozygosity as sources of subline divergence. The fixed-gene differences derived from heterozygosity at 
the barnching generation (X axis) and those derived from mutations during the generations of separation (Y axis) 
have equal contributions where perpendiculars intersect at the curve. The estimated number of fixed-gene 
differences contributed by either source alone is indicated by values entered at various points along the curve. 
For example, two sublines that branched at generation F25 would be expected to have gained from residual 
heterozygosity 40 fixed-gene differences, and if subsequently maintained separately for 144 generation would be 
expected to have gained from accumulated mutations another 40 fixed-gene differences for a total of 80. Contributions 
from the two sources would have been equal.
