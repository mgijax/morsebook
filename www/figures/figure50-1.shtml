<P>FIGURE 1. Phylogenetic tree depicting relationships among members of the family Muridae. The final extents of 
hybridization shown in

are depicted diagramatically. The distance between divergent lines represents differences in nucleic acid homology 
which is dependent on hybridization conditions and not relative times of divergences from a common ancestor.
